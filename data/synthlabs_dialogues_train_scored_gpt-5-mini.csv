gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Good morning, Doctor. Ah, I’ve been better, honestly. The numbness in my legs has really kicked up a notch lately. It’s like I’ve got cotton stuffed inside, you know? It’s frustrating — I feel like I’ve lost a bit of the spring in my step. 
D: Good morning, Emily. I’m glad you came in today. Let’s talk about this numbness. When did you first notice it worsening? Has it been a gradual change or more sudden? 
P: Well, I’d say it’s been creeping up over the past couple of weeks. At first, it was just here and there, a little tingling after long days, especially when I’m tutoring late into the night. But now, it’s like a persistent shadow, almost constant. It does worry me a little—more than usual. It’s tough to ignore. 
D: I understand. The progression of symptoms can be concerning. Have you noticed any other new symptoms—vision changes, dizziness, or balance issues? 
P: Nothing so dramatic, no. My sight remains steady, and I can still stand and walk—though admittedly, the sensation in my legs does make me cautious. I do worry about my independence sometimes. You know how much I cherish my walk in the park or tending to my garden. 
D: Absolutely, and your proactive attitude toward managing this is commendable. We’ll review your current medication and possibly adjust it to better control your symptoms. Have you had any side effects from the medication lately? 
P: Not really, but I’ve heard stories, you know, from others with MS—about new drugs or changes causing more issues. I don’t want to be reckless, but I also need to keep my momentum for work and my passions. I believe in fighting this with everything I’ve got. Just like I do with my students. 
D: That’s a very strong mindset, Emily. We’ll carefully consider the options—perhaps a tweak or an addition, to better manage the numbness. We’ll also monitor closely for any new symptoms and may advise some physical therapy or adjustments to your daily routine. 
P: That sounds good, Doctor. You know me—I’m not one to sit back. I’ll do anything I can to stay active. Speaking of which, I’m curious—how do I balance my love for extreme sports with this condition? Sometimes I feel torn between my passions and my health. 
D: It’s about pacing yourself and listening to your body. Some activities might need modification, but your passion for adventure can still be part of your life—safely. We’ll tailor a plan that keeps you moving without risking your health. 
P: Ah, that’s just what I needed to hear. I can’t let MS define me or curb my spirit. I believe faith and resilience are what carry me through. Thank you, Doctor. I’ll trust your guidance. 
D: I admire your strength, Emily. Let’s get some tests done and follow up soon to see how you’re doing. Remember, we’re in this together. 
P: Thank you. Truly, it helps knowing I’ve got a team in my corner. And I promise, I won’t let this take the wind out of my sails.

Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct,,"P: Hi, Doc! Thanks for squeezing me in today. I feel like I'm at my wit's end with this pain.
D: Of course, Sarah. I'm happy to help. Can you tell me more about what's been going on? When did you notice the pain start to worsen?
P: Honestly, it's been creeping up on me for months, but the past few weeks have been brutal. I'm talking eight or nine out of ten, some days. My rock climbing trips have been shorter and shorter... and that's just not me.
D: I see. You're experiencing more pain in your lower back and legs, I assume? Any numbness or tingling?
P: Yeah, both. Sometimes I feel like my legs are on fire, other times they just go numb. Like someone's switched the lights off, you know? My adaptive equipment can only help so much when the pain is this intense.
D: That sounds incredibly difficult. Have you noticed any changes in your pain patterns since our last appointment? Any triggers or relieving factors?
P: To be honest, I've just been feeling really frustrated and overwhelmed. The pain seems to get worse when I've been sitting or standing in one position for too long. The only thing that helps is my faith, to some extent... just knowing I'm not alone in this journey. That, and a good distraction – I've been volunteering more with our local church's youth group, which helps shift my focus.
D: I'm glad to hear you've found some sources of comfort, Sarah. Faith and community can be incredibly powerful tools. We'll need to reassess your medication regimen and possibly look into some additional options, such as nerve blocks or physical therapy.
P: That sounds good to me. I'm open to anything that might help me regain some independence. And, equally important, allow me to enjoy those movie nights with friends again. Losing my social life would be... harsh, to say the least.
D: We'll work together to find the right combination of treatments, okay? Also, I think it's time for some new imaging tests to see if there have been any changes in your spinal cord injury.
P: Okay, sounds like a plan. Thanks for always being honest and thorough, Doc. Just knowing you're in my corner makes a difference.
D: That's what I'm here for, Sarah. Let's get you set up with those tests and start working on some new solutions for your pain management. I want to get you back to rock climbing and photography as soon as possible.

Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct,,"P: Ah, thank goodness I made it on time, Doctor. Traffic was dreadful today.
D: Good morning, Emily. Yes, traffic can be a challenge. How have you been feeling since our last visit?
P: Honestly, a bit of a rollercoaster. The numbness in my legs has gotten worse. It's like pins and needles, but it doesn't go away, and I'm getting worried it'll affect my rock climbing. I know it sounds crazy, but that's my sanity, you know?
D: I understand. Your rock climbing is important to you, and we want to keep you doing what you love. Can you tell me more about these numbness episodes? How often are they happening, and have you noticed any triggers?
P: It's almost every day now. Sometimes, it's just when I wake up, and other times it's after I've been sitting for a while. And the weirdest part is, when I'm stressed or anxious, it's like my legs are on fire. Well, not on fire, exactly, but it feels like ants are crawling all over them. Does that make any sense?
D: It makes perfect sense, Emily. These symptoms are consistent with your multiple sclerosis. I'd like to run some tests and review your current medication plan. We may need to adjust your dosages or consider other options to manage these new symptoms.
P: Okay, what kind of tests? And what does this mean for my long-term outlook? I don't want to lose my independence, Doctor. I've worked too hard for that.
D: The tests will give us a better picture of the disease progression. I want to reassure you that we'll do everything we can to slow it down and manage your symptoms. We'll work together to ensure your independence is preserved for as long as possible.
P: Gracias, Doctor. Thank you. Just knowing that gives me hope.
D: Of course, Emily. We'll also discuss some lifestyle adjustments to help manage your symptoms. Perhaps some modifications to your exercise routine?
P: Oh, you want to take away my rock climbing? Not on your life, Doctor! But seriously, I'm open to suggestions. What did you have in mind?
D: Actually, I was thinking of incorporating some exercises that might help with balance and strength. We'll also discuss ways to manage stress and anxiety, as those seem to trigger your symptoms.
P: Ah, that makes sense. And I've been meaning to ask, have you heard of any studies on the effects of prayer and meditation on multiple sclerosis? I find solace in my faith, and I'm curious if there's any scientific basis for its benefits.
D: There is some research suggesting that mindfulness practices, including prayer and meditation, can have a positive impact on stress management and overall well-being. I can look into some specific studies if you'd like.
P: That would be wonderful, Doctor. Thank you for understanding the importance of faith in my life.
D: Of course, Emily. I want to assure you that we'll take a holistic approach to your care, considering all aspects of your life, not just the physical symptoms.
P: That means more to me than you'll ever know, Doctor. Just knowing I have your support gives me the strength to face whatever comes next.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Hola, doctor. Gracias por atenderme hoy. La verdad, últimamente estas migrañas no me dejan en paz. Antes eran ocasionales, pero ahora parece que no puedo controlarlas, y la intensidad... ya no sé si esto es normal, o si algo más está pasando.
D: Buen día, Marcela. Entiendo su preocupación, y es importante que investiguemos qué podría estar causando estos cambios. ¿Desde cuándo empezó a notar este aumento en la frecuencia y gravedad de las migrañas?
P: Hace unos meses, pero en las últimas semanas, ya se han vuelto más intensas y frecuentes. Hasta me impiden seguir con mis clases y hasta la adrenalina que busco en mis deportes ya no ayuda como antes. Es como si la vida misma me estuviera poniendo barreras, ¿sabe?
D: Es comprensible que esto le afecte en su día a día. ¿ Puede decirme si ha notado algún patrón con respecto a los momentos en que aparecen, o si ciertos factores parecen desencadenarlas más?
P: La mayoría las tengo en la tarde, especialmente cuando estoy bajo mucho estrés, y a veces después de pasar horas frente a la computadora o leyendo, que en mi trabajo es inevitable. También, la falta de sueño o alimentación irregular parecen empeorarlas, pero esas cosas a veces son difíciles de controlar.
D: Es bueno que identifique estos posibles desencadenantes. Además, ¿Ha notado también otros síntomas con las migrañas, como cambios en la visión, náuseas o sensibilidad a la luz y el sonido?
P: Sí, doctor, la visión se me nubla antes del dolor, y a veces vomito. El otro día casi no podía enfocar. La luz brillante y los ruidos fuertes parecen hasta empeorar el dolor.
D: Todo eso indica que debemos hacer algunos estudios para descartar causas más serias y entender mejor qué está sucediendo. ¿Cómo ha estado manejando el dolor en estas últimas semanas?
P: La verdad, he probado de todo: descanso, café, analgésicos. Pero nada funciona del todo. A veces solo espero que pase, y cuando llega, me siento exhausta y angustiada, pensando en lo peor.
D: Entiendo que eso le cause mucha angustia, Marcela. Lo importante ahora es determinar si hay una causa tratable y cómo controlamos estos episodios. Le recomendaré algunos exámenes y, mientras tanto, podemos ajustar el tratamiento para aliviar los síntomas y reducir la frecuencia.
P: Gracias, doctor. Espero que podamos hacer algo al respecto. No quiero que esto me devore la vida, aunque a veces siento que ya no puedo con más.
D: Haré todo lo posible para ayudarla. Recuerde también que controlar el estrés y mantener un ritmo de vida regular puede ser fundamental. Seguiremos en contacto y ajustaremos el plan según los resultados.
P: Eso espero, y gracias otra vez. La verdad, a veces uno solo necesita que alguien escuche y se tome esto en serio.

gpt-5,medium,"P: Morning, doc. I wish I were here with a stack of mountain photos, but my nerves are throwing a rave in my lower back and legs.
D: I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. Tell me how the pain’s changed.
P: It’s sharper, more electric. Left leg worse than right. Baseline’s about a 7 most days, flares hit 9 at night. Cold and sitting too long make it scream. Heat and distraction help a bit.
D: Any numbness, new weakness, or changes with bowel or bladder?
P: No new bladder or bowel drama, thank God. Strength feels about the same. More pins-and-needles, more touch sensitivity—my shins hate even a blanket.
D: How’s it affecting your day-to-day?
P: I’ve had to cut climbing sessions short. Photography trips are shorter too—car rides set it off. I’m still volunteering, but I’m knackered by late afternoon.
D: What are you taking right now?
P: Gabapentin 600 mg three times a day. Duloxetine 30 mg in the morning. Baclofen 10 mg at night if the spasms get cheeky. Lidocaine patches when I remember. Ibuprofen when I get stubborn, which I know does sod all for nerve pain.
D: Any side effects?
P: Brain fog, a bit of weight creeping on, and the duloxetine made my stomach sulk for a week but that settled.
D: Sleep?
P: Choppy. I doze, then the zaps wake me. I pray, breathe, sometimes watch some daft sitcom till the storm passes.
D: Mood and stress?
P: I’m pretty upbeat to the outside world, but I’m anxious about the long haul—will I keep my independence, can I afford all this? Faith and friends keep me afloat, mostly.
D: Any falls or near-falls?
P: One near topple getting out of the car last week. Caught myself, dignity mostly intact.
D: On exam today your strength is stable, reflexes are unchanged, and I’m seeing increased allodynia along the shins. No red flags. I think we should adjust your regimen.
P: I’m listening, with only mild skepticism and a sprinkle of hope.
D: Option one: switch from gabapentin to pregabalin—often better tolerated and more effective for this kind of pain. Option two: increase duloxetine to 60 mg. We can also add scheduled lidocaine patches. And I’d like to bring in PT for desensitization and pacing, plus a pain psychologist for coping strategies. How does that sound?
P: I’d like less fog and more function. I’m wary of upping meds if I turn into a zombie. And I don’t want opioids.
D: No opioids. We’ll cross-taper to pregabalin slowly and see if the fog improves. We can increase duloxetine if you tolerate it. We’ll keep baclofen as is unless spasms flare.
P: Okay. Give me the “how” in plain English.
D: Week 1: start pregabalin 75 mg at night; reduce your evening gabapentin to 300 mg. Week 2: pregabalin 75 mg twice daily; gabapentin 300 mg three times daily. Week 3: pregabalin 150 mg twice daily; stop gabapentin. If you’re too sedated, we slow down.
P: Got it. And duloxetine?
D: After one week, if nausea is minimal, increase duloxetine to 60 mg each morning. If your stomach protests, we’ll pause.
P: Patches?
D: Lidocaine 5% patch to the most tender area—12 hours on, 12 off, daily.
P: Any labs or scans?
D: I’ll order basic labs including liver enzymes before increasing duloxetine. No imaging today—your exam doesn’t suggest new structural issues.
P: What about something fancy like nerve blocks or those zappy spine gadgets?
D: We can refer to pain management. They can assess for options like high-concentration capsaicin patches or, if needed, advanced interventions. We’ll see how you do with this adjustment first.
P: PT I can handle. Just not endless rubber bands, please.
D: I’ll specify desensitization, core stabilization, and pacing around your adaptive sports. Also a short course with the pain psychologist for sleep and flare planning.
P: Sounds almost civilized.
D: For sleep, okay to try melatonin 3 mg at night. Keep a consistent schedule, cool room, heat pack on the legs before bed.
P: Copy that. Wallet-wise, I’m a bit stretched. Any help there?
D: I’ll loop in our social worker to check coverage for meds, PT, and adaptive equipment grants.
P: Thank you. That eases the Sunday-night panic.
D: Any interest in low-dose naltrexone? Off-label, sometimes helps neuropathic pain. Minimal side effects for most.
P: I’ve heard whispers. Let’s park it till we see what pregabalin does.
D: Fair. Red flags to call me immediately: new weakness, saddle numbness, fever with back pain, or any bladder/bowel changes.
P: Understood. No heroics, I’ll call.
D: When should we follow up—two to four weeks?
P: Let’s do four. Gives me time to test it on a short park trip.
D: I’ll send the cross-taper schedule, labs today, PT and pain psychology referrals, and a social work consult. Message me if side effects hit hard.
P: Deal. If this calms the rave in my legs, I’m bringing you a postcard from the next summit.
D: I’ll hold you to it. Take care, Sarah.
P: Cheers, doc. Here’s to quieter nerves and louder laughter.

D: Not at all, Ms. Soto. It's nice to meet you too. What seems to be the problem? You've been experiencing migraines?
P: Yeah... more often than usual. Sometimes I can go months without one, but recently... it's like they never stop. The pain's worse too. Sometimes it's unbearable. It interferes with my work as a tutor. And it's stressing me out.
D: I understand. That can be debilitating. When did you first start experiencing migraines?
P: Oh, as long as I can remember... definitely since my teenage years. But I learned to live with them. Chilean remedies – my abuela used to tell me to take some ibuprofen and have a lie-down. That doesn't work as well as it used to.
D: I see. Any noticeable triggers that might be causing this recent increase?
P: Not really. Other than my ridiculous stress levels. You see, my students... some are really struggling, and their parents... Expectations are so high, and it all falls on me. I sometimes wonder if I'm making any difference at all.
D: I understand. Have you noticed any other symptoms? Sensitivity to light or sound, maybe?
P: Oh, absolutely. A tiny bit of sunlight and I'm done for. It's like I'm some kind of vampire. Even sound. Sometimes, just my neighbor's niece practicing piano is like nails on a chalkboard. Horrible. And nausea. It's terrible. I love to cook – Chilean dishes, my comfort food... and even the smell of onions makes me want to vomit sometimes.
D: I see. We'll need to run some tests, rule out other possible causes for these headaches. In the meantime, I'd like you to try some new medication to help manage the pain.
P: Medication? Look, Doctor... I understand... I just... I hate taking medication if it's not necessary. And what about the long-term effects? I'm not exactly rolling in money – what if it's expensive?
D: I understand your concerns, Marcela. Let me tell you about the medication I'm recommending...
P: Wait, and will this medication make me drowsy? Because if I'm drowsy, I'll get behind on grading, and my students will fall behind, and I... 
D: I assure you, Marcela, this medication has minimal side effects. And we'll monitor you closely to make sure it's working effectively. It's not a permanent solution – it's a stepping stone to help us figure out the cause of these migraines. Can I reassure you of that?
P: Okay. Thank you, Doctor. Sorry I'm being a bit... much.
D: Not at all, Marcela. We'll work together to figure this out. I want you to keep a headache journal, track your symptoms, and come back in two weeks so we can reevaluate. Sound good?

D: Hi Emily, hello again. The trip was good, thanks for asking. How are things with you since we last met? 
P: Oh, let me catch up on that while you look through my chart. So many new faces and young people around here lately – it gets quiet at the library after 5 PM now! But I’ve been trying out a new rock climbing gym downtown; they have great classes for those who are more...uh, challenged physically.
D: Are you finding any particular activities help with your MS symptoms better than others?
P: Definitely! Gardening has been my meditation over the weekends. It’s quieter and helps me connect with nature too. And as always, I find teaching incredibly rewarding. Though sometimes I worry about how long I can balance all of it.
D: Have you noticed any new flare-ups or changes in your condition that might warrant our attention?
P: Yeah actually, there's the main reason for my visit today. My legs have been getting more and more numb since last month. It’s tough to ignore when reaching out for things becomes a challenge again.
D: Ah yes, I see here you noted some increased muscle weakness too. Have you felt this way before?
P: Oh absolutely, but it tends to come in these waves – up then down—rather unpredictable compared to my MS symptoms from years back. Is there something different now we need to adjust for?
D: Might be time to review your current treatment plan and perhaps introduce another medication that could help manage the exacerbations better.

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Good morning, Doctor. I’m Marcela Soto, 45, a private tutor who prides herself on handling things on her own.
D: Good morning, Marcela. Tell me what’s been going on with your migraines.
P: They’re back and worse this time. The last 6–8 weeks have been rougher than before.
P: I’m now getting headaches about 6–8 days a month, and they last 4–6 hours—sometimes longer.
P: The pain is a throbbing, usually one-sided thing, though a few attacks have been bilateral.
P: There’s typically a warning aura about 10–15 minutes—those zig-zag lines or flickers—then the nausea and sensitivity to light and sound hit.
P: They’ve even woken me up at night a few times, which wrecks my teaching days.
P: I’ve tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen; they help sometimes, but they’re not cutting it lately. Triptans helped in the past but not consistently.
P: My job is freelance, so the uncertainty adds a lot of stress and seems to trigger more headaches.
P: On weekends I chase adrenaline—mountain biking, sometimes paragliding. Exertion can trigger headaches, but it also makes life feel real and in control.
P: I’m worried this could be something serious—like a brain issue—and the thought keeps nagging at me.
P: I don’t want to become dependent on daily meds; I want to stay productive and keep teaching.
P: If we can pin down the triggers and find a plan that actually works, I think I’ll feel less weary.
D: I hear you. Let’s go step by step and ease your mind.
D: I’ll start with a quick neurological check and some questions about patterns and meds.
D: Any red flags recently—thunderclap headache, weakness, trouble speaking, confusion, fever, neck stiffness?
P: Not really. I don’t have weakness or speech trouble; the headaches feel like the usual migraine picture.
D: Family history? Have migraines or vascular problems shown up in relatives?
P: My mother has migraines; she warned me about possible med overuse.
D: Okay. To summarize: about 6–8 headache days per month, each lasting 4–6 hours; throbbing pain, often unilateral; aura in some attacks; nausea, photophobia; triggers include stress, irregular sleep, skipped meals, dehydration, weather; caffeine has mixed effects; sleep is inconsistent; you exercise regularly and push your limits on weekends.
D: I’ll perform a brief exam now. If all looks normal, we’ll discuss management.
P: Fine.
D: The plan is to start with a headache diary to track frequency, triggers, and response to treatments.
D: For acute attacks, start with an NSAID or acetaminophen early, add an antiemetic if needed, and consider a triptan for moderate-to-severe attacks—especially with aura.
D: We’ll be careful with medication overuse; limit acute meds to about 2–3 days per week.
D: If headaches persist at a disabling level or occur on ≥8 days per month, we’ll consider preventive therapy.
D: Preventive options include a beta-blocker , an antidepressant , an anticonvulsant , or a CGRP inhibitor—tailored to you.
P: I’d like to start with something light if possible, maybe a low-dose amitriptyline at night, and see how I tolerate it.
D: We can trial a low-dose amitriptyline, monitoring for daytime sleepiness, dryness, or weight changes.
P: And about imaging—when would we order an MRI or CT?
D: Imaging isn’t routine unless red flags appear or there’s a new pattern or alarming symptoms. If you remain concerned, we can schedule baseline imaging and review results at follow-up.
P: That sounds reasonable.
D: We’ll also emphasize lifestyle adjustments: regular meals, hydration, stable sleep, limit caffeine and alcohol, stress management, and balanced exercise.
P: I can commit to keeping a diary and making those changes.
D: Great. I’ll see you in 6–8 weeks to review the diary, adjust treatment, and discuss next steps.
P: Thanks, Doctor. I feel more hopeful already.

gpt-5-mini,high,"P: Hola, doctor. Thank you for seeing me. I'm a little nervous — my migraines have been getting much worse and I'm terrified it might be something serious.
D: Good morning, Marcela. I'm Dr. Morales. Tell me from the beginning — when did this change start and what do you mean by ""much worse""?
P: I've had migraines since my twenties, usually one every month or so. Over the past three months they've become almost weekly. Some weeks I have two or three. They last a long time — a whole day, sometimes two. The pain is a pounding, usually on the left side, very sensitive to light and sound, and I get so nauseous I can't eat. Sometimes I see little flashing lights before it starts.
D: Those flashing lights sound like visual aura. Do you ever have weakness, numbness, slurred speech, difficulty walking, or confusion with the headaches?
P: No weakness or trouble speaking, nothing like that. Once, after a hard fall mountain biking six months ago, I had a headache for a few days but I didn't pass out. No seizures, either.
D: Any recent fever, weight loss, night sweats, or new vision changes between attacks?
P: No fever. I have felt more tired and a bit low because of the headaches — and work is stressful — but no dramatic weight loss. My vision returns to normal after the flashing lights.
D: What do you take for the pain now?
P: Mostly ibuprofen or paracetamol, whatever I have at home. If it's really bad, I sometimes take both. Lately I've been taking something almost every other day, sometimes more. I haven't used triptans regularly — I'm a bit wary of stronger drugs.
D: How many days per month would you say you take simple analgesics for headaches?
P: Ugh — probably 15 to 20 days some months. I know that sounds terrible. I was afraid of that.
D: That frequency raises concern for medication-overuse headache, which can make migraines more frequent. It also explains why they could be worsening.
P: Of course. Of course it's my fault. I always expect the worst. But — and I'm embarrassed — I worry it could be a tumor. My relatives keep asking if I've seen a neurologist. They say ""you should be checked.""
D: I understand the worry. A new pattern of headaches, especially when they change in frequency or severity, is a reasonable reason to investigate. I will examine you now, and we'll decide about imaging. Do you mind if I do a quick neurologic exam?
P: Go ahead. Please. I just want to know what's happening.
D: Your cranial nerves are intact. Strength, sensation, coordination and reflexes are normal. Gait is stable. No papilledema when I look at the back of the eyes. Everything is normal on exam.
P: That's a relief. Still, it feels different. The pain is stronger and it knocks me out for a day. I can't work; I lose income. I'm a private tutor — if I'm away, I lose clients. That makes me more anxious and probably worse.
D: That added stress matters. Irregular sleep, missed meals, and stress are common migraine triggers. Tell me about your sleep, caffeine, and eating.
P: Sleep is irregular — I tutor at odd hours sometimes — and I drink coffee to stay awake. Skipping lunch happens when I'm late. I also love mountain biking and paragliding; I know that sounds reckless, but it's my balance. I try to exercise, but I wonder if that triggers things too.
D: Exercise is usually protective, but intense exertion during a prodrome can trigger an attack. Also, frequent caffeine and irregular meals can be triggers. Given your pattern — long-standing migraine now more frequent, daily analgesic use, normal exam — the most likely causes are chronic migraine with medication overuse and possibly hormonal changes at your age. However, because the headaches have changed, an MRI is reasonable to reassure you and to rule out other structural causes.
P: So you think an MRI will prove it's not a tumor?
D: An MRI can't prove absolute certainty, but it is the best noninvasive test to look for structural problems. The chance that this is a tumor is low based on your history and normal exam, but I will order an MRI to address your concern and to have a baseline.
P: Thank you. I know it's probably nothing dramatic, but the anxiety makes it worse. What can we do in the meantime? I can't take days off work.
D: There are three things we'll do at once. First, for acute attacks: use a specific migraine treatment rather than frequent simple analgesics. Triptans are effective for many people; combining a triptan or a triptan plus an NSAID when needed is often better than taking paracetamol every day. Second, we should stop the daily analgesics — limit them to two days a week at most — to reverse medication-overuse headache. Third, because you have migraines more than eight days a month, I recommend starting a preventive medication to reduce frequency while we wean off overuse.
P: And what about side effects? I can't be foggy for tutoring sessions. I can't afford to lose clients because I feel sleepy.
D: I hear you. We can choose a preventive with a side-effect profile you can tolerate. Low-dose amitriptyline at night helps sleep and headaches, but it can cause drowsiness; propranolol is another option if you don't have asthma or low blood pressure; topiramate works but can affect concentration. We will choose together, start low, and adjust. If you prefer minimal daytime effects, propranolol might be the first choice if it's safe for you.
P: I have never smoked and no asthma. My blood pressure is usually okay. I worry about the cost of tests and meds, but I also don't want to be sick all the time.
D: We'll proceed stepwise. I'll order the MRI and give you a short written plan: an abortive regimen for severe attacks, limits on painkiller use, and a preventive that we agree on. Also keep a headache diary — date, duration, severity, what you took, sleep, meals, caffeine, and activities like biking or paragliding. That helps identify triggers and shows objective improvement.
P: Headache diary — fine. I can do that. Will I need a neurologist?
D: If the MRI is normal and your headaches improve with the plan, we can continue here. If they don't improve, if the MRI shows anything concerning, or if the pattern becomes more complex, I'll refer you to neurology. We can also consider newer treatments like CGRP inhibitors down the line if preventives fail.
P: And about paragliding — can I keep doing it? I love it, honestly. It's the only time I feel really alive.
D: I won't tell you to stop living. But practical advice: avoid flying when you have aura or feel a migraine coming, and don't push yourself during a prodrome. If you have visual disturbances during flight, it can be unsafe. Helmets for biking, yes — always — and avoid extreme exertion at the earliest signs of an attack.
P: That makes sense. One more thing — when I try to stop the daily ibuprofen, will the headaches get worse before they get better?
D: They can. Withdrawal from overused analgesics often causes a temporary increase in headache frequency or intensity for a week or two. That's why starting an effective abortive plan and beginning preventive therapy at the same time helps. We'll support you through that period and I can provide rescue options for severe days so you can manage your tutoring.
P: I'm relieved you understand the work issue. My relatives already tell me to stop complaining. They don't understand freelancing — it's precarious. I can't just take two weeks off.
D: I know. We'll make the transition practical. I'll write the prescriptions and the MRI order today. Try to limit simple painkillers immediately; use the specific abortive only on the worst days and follow the two-days-a-week rule. Start the preventive we pick, keep the diary, and call if symptoms worsen or if you develop new focal problems like weakness, persistent double vision, fever, or sudden severe ""thunderclap"" headache.
P: Okay. Can you recommend which preventive now, so I can start tonight?
D: Let's try propranolol unless you notice wheezing, lightheadedness, or bradycardia. It's well tolerated for many people and won't make you sleepy. If you feel that's risky, we can start low-dose amitriptyline at bedtime instead. Which would you prefer?
P: I don't want anything that will make me too sleepy. Let's try propranolol.
D: Good. I'll prescribe a low starting dose. We'll review in four weeks, earlier if the MRI shows something or if your headaches change. If propranolol doesn't suit you, we'll switch. Also, cut back on caffeine and aim for regular meals and sleep when possible.
P: All right. Thank you. I'm a little less panicked. I still fear the worst — old habits — but at least there's a plan.
D: That's understandable. We'll get the MRI scheduled and start treatment today. Call us with any new worrying symptoms. We'll work through this together.
P: Gracias, doctor. I appreciate it. I'll do the diary and try to cut down the painkillers. And I'll be careful when I fly.
D: Good. I'll have the nurse help with the prescriptions and MRI paperwork. See you in four weeks, sooner if needed.

gpt-5,high,"P: Good morning, doc. I’m Emily Sutherland—the Chilean choir girl who refuses to stop rock climbing. And… my legs have gone radio-silent again.
D: Good morning, Emily. Let’s go through this carefully. When did the numbness start, and how is it behaving?
P: About ten days ago. At first it was a little colony of hormiguitas marching up from my ankles—on and off. This week it’s constant, both legs, mostly from mid-shin down. Left is sassier than the right.
D: Any weakness or trouble with balance?
P: Not collapsing, gracias a Dios, but I’m catching my toe on curbs. Stairs feel like stepping on marshmallows. I used my trekking pole to get here—sidewalks are a battleground.
D: Any changes with your vision? Double vision, pain with eye movement?
P: No. Eyes are loyal. Still see one choir director, which is plenty.
D: Any bladder or bowel changes? Urgency, accidents, burning with urination?
P: No burning, no accidents. Everything civilized.
D: Fever, recent infection, or significant heat exposure?
P: It’s been sweaty at the school gym where I tutor. The tingling flares there, but now it hangs around even with the A/C. No fever. A tiny sniffle two weeks ago, gone in a day.
D: Remind me of your current MS medications.
P: Dimethyl fumarate, 240 mg twice daily—three years. Vitamin D, magnesium. Baclofen at night if the calves get jumpy, but I hate the morning cloud.
D: Any side effects from the dimethyl fumarate?
P: The pink flush after dinner and occasional stomach mutiny if I don’t eat enough. Manageable. You mentioned my lymphocytes were a bit low last time.
D: Right—absolute lymphocyte count was 0.8 in July. Not unsafe, but trending low. When was your last MRI?
P: Last September. You said “stable-ish,” which I wrote on a sticky note.
D: Given new symptoms lasting over 48 hours, we should repeat MRIs of brain and cervical/thoracic spine with and without contrast to look for active lesions.
P: I can do the tube. I bring my rosary and breathe. Just—no techno music, por favor.
D: I’ll note your musical preferences. On exam today, your strength is full, knee reflexes are brisk, vibration is reduced at the toes, and light touch is dulled from mid-shin down. Tandem walking is a bit unsteady. That aligns with your description.
P: So, relapse or just my nerves being dramatic?
D: It sounds like a relapse. We’ll rule out infection with a urine test and labs. If clear, a short course of high-dose steroids can speed recovery.
P: IV or pills? Last time the IVs made me talk like I’d had five espressos. My students loved it; my choir director did not.
D: We can do high-dose oral steroids at home for three days with a stomach protector. Expect insomnia, mood changes, metallic taste. It won’t change the long-term course, but it often helps symptoms improve faster.
P: Book the insomnia for after Sunday Mass.
D: Now, about your baseline therapy: breakthrough symptoms on dimethyl fumarate suggest we consider a higher-efficacy agent.
P: I guessed that. Give me the headline options.
D: Ofatumumab, a monthly at-home injection, or ocrelizumab, an infusion every six months. Both target B cells and reduce relapses more than dimethyl fumarate. Risks include infections—we’ll screen for hepatitis B and update vaccines. Ocrelizumab can cause infusion reactions; ofatumumab often causes early injection-site reactions.
P: Monthly at home sounds like me. I like independence. What about infection risk compared to what I’m on?
D: Slightly higher, but acceptable for most. We’ll monitor blood counts and immunoglobulins and plan vaccines beforehand since responses are blunted after starting. No live vaccines.
P: Got it. If the MRI lights up like a tree, we switch faster?
D: Yes. Active lesions would strengthen the case. Even without enhancement, the clinical relapse alone is reason to escalate.
P: I’m guarding my independence like treasure. I live alone. I need to carry groceries, wrangle teenagers’ essays, and—within reason—climb.
D: That’s our goal: preserve function. We can also start neuro-physical therapy for gait and balance, and occupational therapy for home/work strategies.
P: PT helps. Those ankle drills feel ridiculous until I don’t trip. Tiny miracles.
D: Any recent falls?
P: A hose tried to assassinate me in the garden. Near-miss. Tomatoes safe.
D: For climbing and paragliding, pause until the numbness settles. Sensory loss affects foot placement. Then resume with extra caution and a vigilant partner.
P: I trust God, but I tie my knots twice. I can take a break.
D: How’s your mood?
P: Depends on the night. Work is good, Mass is grounding. Home can get quiet—too quiet. I keep moving: garden, prayer, my kids—students—keep me honest.
D: I can connect you with an MS support group and a counselor who understands chronic illness. Tools, not replacements.
P: Share the info. I like honesty more than whining.
D: Plan for today: urine and blood tests. MRI within a week. If labs are clear, start a three-day high-dose oral steroid course. I’ll begin screenings and paperwork for ofatumumab so we’re ready if we decide to switch after the MRI.
P: Keep taking dimethyl fumarate until the switch?
D: Yes—no gap.
P: Any choir conflicts with steroids? They make me chatty and hungry—empanadas-at-midnight hungry.
D: Take the dose in the morning to blunt insomnia. Call if sleep is a problem; we can help briefly.
P: I’ll try chamomile and a psalm first. If I start alphabetizing hymnals at 2 a.m., I’ll call.
D: Good. Any other new symptoms? Vision, Lhermitte’s shocks, bladder changes?
P: No new drama. Hands tingle if I type forever, old news.
D: Do you have support for rides?
P: My friend Lucía can help. One student owes me three rides for rescuing his grammar. I’ll collect.
D: Excellent. I’ll send in the coordinator with orders and the ofatumumab booklet. Any last questions?
P: Be honest—am I still on a path to teach, sing, and—carefully—fly?
D: Yes. With the right therapy, rehab, and pacing, you can keep doing those things. We’ll adapt as needed, but your trajectory can remain active and independent.
P: Then vamos. I’ll fight; you do the science. Teamwork.
D: Teamwork. I’ll be back with the paperwork.
P: Gracias, doctor. And if the MRI tech offers techno, tell him Emily prefers Vivaldi—or silence and a prayer.

D: I see. And have you noticed if your nose runs, maybe like a little river running down?
P: Uh-huh, it’s all wet and goopy, like when I splash in puddles but it’s from my nose! It’s yucky. 
D: That sounds like your body is reacting to some sneaky allergens outside. Do you like to play outside a lot?
P: Yes! I make roads for my trucks and dig in the mud. Sometimes I put dirt in my mouth ‘cause it tastes like crunchy earth, but Mom says no. 
D: Your adventurous spirit is wonderful, but that dirt might be causing these sneezes and itchy eyes too. We’ll figure out how to help you feel better, okay?
P: Yay! I want to feel better so I can dig more and build the tallest towers without sneezing on my blocks! 
D: Absolutely. We can try some medicine to stop the sneezing and make your eyes less itchy. Does that sound good?
P: Medicine? Will it taste like chocolate? Or like the syrup I had last time?
D: It might have a little sweet taste to it, but definitely not chocolate. I promise it won’t be too yucky.
P: Okay! I’m brave. I’ll take the medicine if it means I can play outside more and not have my nose be a sneezing monster. 
D: That’s a great plan, Jackson. We’ll also talk to your parents about ways to keep the dirt and pollen away from your nose and eyes when you play outside. Sound good?
P: Yeah! Maybe I can wear a little hat and goggles like a truck driver! Then, no dirt sneaks in!
D: That’s a clever idea! I like how you think. Now, let’s check your breathing and make sure you’re strong enough for all your adventures.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Good afternoon, Doc. Thanks for seeing me today. Just the usual check-in, really. Been keeping an eye on things, but thought it wise to get a proper look.
D: Good afternoon, Mr. Chandler. I appreciate you coming in. How have you been feeling lately? Any new symptoms or concerns?
P: Well, I’d say I’m hanging in there. The odd dizziness sometimes when I stand up too quick, but I figure that’s probably just part of getting on in years, right? Nothing too alarming.
D: That’s common in people managing hypertension. We’ll check your blood pressure today and see if your current medication is doing its job. Have you noticed any unusual headaches or chest tightness?
P: No, weather’s been about normal, and I sleep pretty well, for the most part. I did have a bit of a headache last week, but it went away after a day or two. Might’ve been something I ate, I suppose.
D: It’s good to hear that. Do you remember your last blood pressure reading?
P: Offhand, I think it was around 130 over 80. Pretty steady, I’d say. I’ve tried to maintain a decent routine with the medicine, and I watch my salt intake, like you told me.
D: That’s excellent, Mr. Chandler. Consistency is important. We’ll take your current reading now, and I’ll also check your pulse and listen to your heart. Have you been experiencing any swelling in your legs or shortness of breath?
P: No, nothing like that. I stay active—volunteering at the food bank keeps me on my toes. Gardening and woodworking too. Keeps me going, I suppose.
D: That’s quite the active routine. We’ll keep an eye on your blood pressure, but you’re doing well. If anything changes, do let us know sooner rather than later. Are you still taking your medication twice a day?
P: Yes, sir. The same pills. No plans to change anything unless you tell me to.
D: Good. And I’ll review your medication today, but it seems like you're managing well. Is there anything else bothering you or any questions you’d like to ask?
P: Not right now, Doc. Just want to keep things steady. I value my health, but I don’t want to fuss too much over it. Life’s busy enough as it is.

P: Dr. Kim, good morning. Yes, the stiffness in my fingers is really starting to impact things—I can hardly peel a banana without some grimacing now. I’ve had this jazz playlist playing late at night, but when it stops, and everything falls silent… all that’s left is how my hands feel.
D: It sounds like osteoarthritis might be progressing more than we thought. Have you noticed any changes since our last visit?
P: Well, there's definitely been a shift. I find myself using these arthritis gloves while cooking and gardening now. They seem to offer some kind of comfort during activity, but they're not exactly what I call glamorous or practical for when I'm entertaining guests.
D: Humming has always seemed therapeutic for you, Michelle—I imagine your playlist has had many conversations with those joints of yours by now?
P: [Laughs] Perhaps a bit too many. It’s getting to the point where even the little things are becoming a hurdle. Opening a jar, buttoning my jacket—these daily quirks are starting to feel significant.
D: Alright, let's step back and look at your full picture here. Besides managing the pain, we're trying to keep your mobility and overall quality of life up high. It looks like our previous plan may need some adjustments. What steps have you been taking towards self-care?
P: Yoga classes are a must on my schedule now. The breathing exercises help me unwind from the day’s stress. Besides that, I’ve cut back on working into those late hours as often before.
D: Excellent. We should also talk about physical therapy and maybe even some joint-strengthening exercises. They can be tailored to your lifestyle, helping in both pain management and function enhancement.
P: That sounds promising. The last thing you see when you look at me is the person who runs a firm, though now every motion seems to carry an undercurrent of uncertainty.
D: Don't worry about that side too much yet. Let's start with a few adjustments we can make today to keep your hands happy and your spirit uplifted. We’ll also run a full series of tests to monitor the progress closely from here on in, alongside some non-pharmacological pain relief options.
P: I'm all for it. If there’s any way to get back to my cooking classes without feeling like my fingers are betraying me... 
D: Of course! We’ll find those ways. It's all about balancing your passion with practical solutions that help manage the challenge ahead, Michelle. Remember how adept you’ve always been at handling complex budgets and data? Tackling this osteoarthritis is just another financial detail to handle carefully.

P: He takes all of them, but it definitely takes a bit more coaxing. And even with medication, those coughs still stick around.
D: Okay, we'll keep an eye on things and consider whether additional treatments like inhalers or bronchodilators might be beneficial for him. We can also discuss some tips to try reducing his exposure to irritants at home. How does that sound?

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Good morning, Doctor. I’m Elliot Meyer, a 25-year-old researcher in Boston. Lately my chronic tension headaches have worsened and are starting to interfere with work and concentration. I’d like to understand what’s going on and learn strategies that fit my preference for autonomy and careful, evidence-based planning.
D: Good morning, Elliot. I’m Dr. Patel. I’m glad you’re here. Tell me what you’ve been experiencing.
P: They’ve become more frequent over the past two to three months. They feel like a tight band around my head, bilateral, often starting at the base of the skull and temples. There’s neck and shoulder stiffness, and the pain lasts for hours—two to six hours on average—especially after long days at the computer.
D: How often do they occur and how long do they last?
P: Usually four to five days a week, sometimes longer when meetings run late. The pain is pressing and dull rather than pulsating; light sensitivity can show up after several hours, but there’s no nausea, no aura, and no neurological deficits.
D: Any red flags or symptoms that worry you?
P: Not really. I’m generally healthy. I am, however, anxious by nature, and I worry about whether this is just stress or something more serious. I also worry about relying too much on analgesics and developing rebound headaches.
D: Do you use caffeine or analgesics regularly?
P: I drink a couple of coffees most mornings, maybe a second in the afternoon. I’ll take acetaminophen or ibuprofen for relief when needed, but not daily—still, I’m cautious about overuse.
D: Okay. I’ll do a quick exam and check your vitals.

D: Your exam is normal, vitals are stable. This pattern is consistent with chronic tension-type headaches. Let’s outline a plan to manage it and watch for any changes.
P: I appreciate a plan that respects my autonomy and emphasizes evidence-based, non-pharmacologic options first. I want to avoid medication dependence unless it’s clearly needed.
D: Here’s what I suggest: 1) Optimize lifestyle and workstation; 2) Address stress and sleep; 3) Guidance on acute relief; 4) Consider prophylaxis if needed; 5) Start a headache diary; 6) Follow-up in 4–6 weeks.
P: That sounds right. If we do consider prophylaxis, I’d be open to a low-dose amitriptyline at night, especially if sleep or mood issues emerge.
D: We’ll tailor as we go. In the meantime, focus on ergonomics, regular breaks, hydration, and stress management. We’ll review your diary and adjust.
P: I’ll start the diary today and aim for a steady sleep schedule, better posture, and scheduled breaks. I’m curious to see what patterns show up.
D: Excellent. I’ll give you a simple diary template and a handout on relief-friendly stretches. We’ll check back in 4–6 weeks or sooner if things worsen.

D: Hello, Malachi. I’m Dr. Chen. I’ll listen to your tummy and ask a few questions to understand what’s going on.
P: It started a few weeks ago. It comes and goes. Mostly in the middle of my belly, and it’s worse when we change our morning routine.
D: On a scale from 0 to 10, where is your pain right now? Is it sharp, crampy, or dull? Does it wake you up at night?
P: Today it’s about a 3. It feels like a cramp. It goes away after we eat or after I get a hug from Mom. It hasn’t woken me at night.
D: Do you have other symptoms with the pain—fever, throwing up, diarrhea, constipation, or blood in your stool?
P: Not really. Sometimes I feel a little sick when I know I’m going to preschool, but I feel better after a few minutes.
D: How about your bowel habits? Do you go at a regular time? Any big changes in appetite?
P: I go to the bathroom sometimes, but not every day. Some days I don’t want to eat much when my tummy is grumpy, other days I want a lot.
D: It’s common for kids your age to have tummy pains when they’re worried or there are changes in routines. We call this functional abdominal pain.
P: My family loves stories and library trips on weekends. Changes make me nervous, and my tummy aches more when we do something new.
D: Thank you for sharing that. We’ll plan to keep routines as much as possible and talk about changes ahead of time. We also want to watch for red flags: weight loss, fever, vomiting, blood in stool, or pain that lasts all night. If any of those happen, come in sooner.

D: For now, to help with the tummy grumbles, try: regular meals and snacks, plenty of water, gentle physical activity, and a simple belly-breathing exercise to calm down when you feel the pain coming.
P: How do I do belly breathing? I like pretending I’m blowing bubbles with my mouth.
D: Here’s a quick way: breathe in through your nose for 3 counts, hold for 2, and blow out like you’re blowing a big bubble for 4 counts. Do this a few times when you start to feel the pain.
P: I can try that. I’ll also bring my dinosaur toy to the appointment; it helps me feel brave.
D: Wonderful. We’ll also keep a simple pain diary—draw or mark a happy face on days you feel well and a sad face on days with tummy pain. Your parents can help you review it to see patterns.
P: Okay. If the pain stays, can I take something? Like medicine?
D: Not right now. We’ll start with coping strategies and routines. If the pain becomes more frequent or severe, we can discuss options with your parents. And if you feel worse, call the clinic.
P: My stomach hurts when the alarm clock rings in the morning.
D: That’s a common trigger. We’ll plan for a predictable morning: a calm wake-up, a quick snack, and you can bring a small toy to hold onto.
P: I’m a shy kid in new groups, but I like sharing my toys once I trust someone.
D: You’re right to notice that. We’ll support you with gradual transitions. I’d like to see you back in about 4 to 6 weeks to check how the pain is doing.
P: Thank you, Doctor. I’ll try the breathing and bring my dinosaur.
D: You’re welcome, Malachi. See you soon. If you have a big drop-off at preschool next week, tell your teacher you need a minute to settle in.

gpt-4.1,,"P: *climbs onto the exam table, swinging his legs* Hi! My name’s Jackson. I brung my truck, see? He can go vroom vroom. 
D: Hello, Jackson! That’s a cool truck you’ve got there. What brings you and your truck in to see me today? 
P: My nose keeps drippin’ everywhere. Mama says I sound like a baby elephant, ‘cause I sneeze lots an' it’s noisy. I don’t WANT a drippy nose. 
D: I bet that’s uncomfortable. Can you tell me when your nose started feeling drippy and when you started sneezing so much? 
P: Umm… when the flowers came out. There were yellow ones everywhere! And some bugs. And then my eyes got so itchy, I rubbed ‘em and Mama said “Don’t do that, Jackson!” 
D: That makes sense. Sometimes flowers and bugs come back in the spring and cause allergies. Besides your nose and eyes, have you been coughing or had trouble breathing? 
P: Nope. I run real fast in the backyard, ‘cept sometimes I hafta stop to wipe my nose. It gets on my sleeve. Mama says yuck and gives me tissues. Do you got any dinosaur tissues here? 
D: We might have some fun ones, let me check for you in a bit. Does anything else bother you? Maybe your throat, or your skin? 
P: My throat is… um… sometimes scratchy, but not a lot. No bumps though! And I don’t like when my face feels sticky. Itchy eyes are the worst! 
D: Okay, thanks for telling me, Jackson. Do the sneezing and itchiness happen more inside the house, or only when you’re playing outside? 
P: Mostly outside. When I’m diggin’ up dirt for my trucks, then I go ACHOO. Oops, sorry! I didn’t get any on you, did I? 
D: Nope, you’re good. It sounds like being outside makes your allergies act up. Do you ever get these symptoms at bedtime or when you’re watching cartoons? 
P: Hmm… Just a little at bedtime. I like when Mama reads me bunny stories ‘cause bunnies don’t make me sneeze. No trucks in the bed, though. That’s the rules. 
D: Great job explaining, Jackson. I think you have something called seasonal allergies. That means things like pollen in the air make your nose and eyes feel funny sometimes. 
P: Oh! So it’s like, flower dust is sneaky? Does it get in my trucks too? ‘Cause they got all muddy last week. 
D: You’re right, flower dust—the pollen—is sneaky and can get everywhere, even trucks. But with some medicine, we can help your nose and eyes feel better. Would you like to try something to make your sneezes go away? 
P: Yes please! But if it tastes like broccoli, I don’t want it. 
D: Don’t worry, it’s usually a tiny pill or a sweet syrup, much better than broccoli. Your mom and dad will help you take it. They’ll also show you how to wash your hands and face after playing outside to help, too. 
P: If I do all that, can I still make mud roads for my trucks? 
D: Absolutely! You just might need a tissue pit stop once in a while. 
P: Yay! I’m gonna build the biggest mud mountain ever. Um… can my toy truck get a sticker if I’m brave? 
D: Your truck and you both get stickers today—deal? 
P: Deal! And look—I’m not even scared of doctor stuff. ‘Cause I’m four and ALLIGATOR strong! 
D: I can tell! You’re as strong as an alligator and as brave as a lion. Thanks for being such a great helper, Jackson.

qwen2.5:14b,,"P: Good morning, Doc.
D: Morning, Walter. How’ve you been? I hear your blood pressure hasn’t responded as well as we hoped.
P: Yeah, it’s a worry. Lately, the numbers have me second-guessing myself every day—can I do anything to help it?
D: Well, let’s start by getting some readings. Do you feel any different lately? Any changes in your routine?
P: Sometimes my head feels like it’s spinning when I get up from sitting down or something.
D: It sounds like we might need a tweak on the medications if that’s happening often. How are things at home? Still playing music and taking care of those plants, as usual?
P: Yes, ma’am. The old sunroom does me good with some quiet time each day, but there's nothing else out of the ordinary going on.
D: Alright, let’s bring you back here again for some new readings today. We’ll also talk about adjusting your meds so we can get those dizzy spells under control. How does that sound?
P: Sounds good to me. Just want things settled down a bit more, if I can help it.
D: Of course, Walter. It’s all part of the plan here—keeping our seniors as healthy as possible. Let’s get this done and you’re free to go right away. How has Margaret been holding up?
P: She’s doing well in church groups and social activities, but she worries about me and my high blood pressure too.
D: I’ll have a note sent over for her next check-up then with recommendations as well. Let’s see how this goes first though. We’re not just looking out for you, but also your family’s peace of mind.
P: Good to know, Doc—appreciate it. Can’t thank you enough for taking the time on all these visits.
D: No worries at all, Walter; that’s what I’m here for. Now, let's get those readings and see where we stand today, okay?
P: Sure thing. Just trying to do my part to stay in this world a bit longer without it causing too much stress or bother.

D: Good morning, Mr. Chandler. Yes, we’re doing a routine follow-up today. How have you been feeling lately? 
P: Well, I’d say I’m managing. Still tending to the garden, still working with the grandkids on their homework—though my knees complain a bit more than they used to. Overall, I’d say I’m in pretty good shape for a fellow of my age. 
D: That’s good to hear. Have you noticed any changes in your symptoms or any new concerns since your last visit? 
P: Nothing out of the ordinary, really. No headaches or dizziness, no sudden spikes of anything that worries me. You know, I’ve been on the same meds now for a few months. My wife says I don’t seem to be as winded when I climb the stairs. That’s a relief. 
D: That’s encouraging. Let’s check your blood pressure today and see how it’s doing. Have you been sticking to your medication schedule? 
P: Absolutely, like clockwork. I even set a reminder on my phone—don’t tell my grandkids, I’m still trying to keep up with their texting routines. 
D: That’s good to hear. Okay, let’s get a reading now. Just relax, Mr. Chandler. 
P: Relax? Ha! That’s a tall order for a fidgety old man like me, but I’ll do my best. 
 
D: Your blood pressure today is a bit lower than last time. That’s a positive sign. 
P: Well, I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t relieved to hear that. Always a bit of a worry when those numbers go up, you know. I’d rather keep them steady. 
D: Absolutely. We’ll keep an eye on it, but your current medication seems effective. Do you have any questions or concerns about your treatment? 
P: Not so much questions, no. Just— I appreciate the straightforwardness, Doc. You’ve always been honest with me, which I value. I guess I just worry about getting too old for this kind of thing. 
D: That’s completely understandable. Aging brings its challenges, but managing your health proactively makes a difference. Keep up with your routines, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you notice anything unusual. 
P: Will do. And I’ll keep plugging away in the garden and in the shed. Keeps me grounded, you might say. Thanks for your time, really.

D: It's nice to see you again, Monica. How have you been feeling in the meantime?
P: Well, I wake up each morning wondering if today will be one of those off days where every step feels like a landslide trying to push boulders uphill.
D: Yes, MS can certainly have its unpredictable moments. Can you tell me more about what’s happening with your muscle weakness and fatigue specifically?
P: Right, so besides the usual stiffness in the mornings, my left leg has really started giving out on me lately. Like it’s trying to go on strike or something.
D: That doesn’t sound great. Have there been any changes that might correlate with this new symptom?
P: Not really, I mean I’ve stuck pretty much to routine as usual. But just thinking about how my body’s changing gets under my skin more each day.
D: It sounds like you’re handling it all quite calmly. How is your current treatment working for you? Are there any side effects that are particularly bothersome?
P: Yeah, I’ll be honest—it feels like drinking from an energy drink while simultaneously taking a chill pill doesn’t exactly mix well with reality. Plus, the MRI last time showed progression...
D: Yes, managing MS requires being proactive and adjusting treatments as we go along. Let’s talk about options to help with the fatigue and weakness.
P: Great, because I’d rather not be a human sloth trapped in my own home forever if I can avoid it. So, what do you suggest?
D: We might consider adding an adjuvant therapy that helps manage fatigue better while keeping other symptoms at bay. Also, physical therapy could be beneficial for strengthening your muscles.
P: Physical therapy? That’s going to add so much more time into my day already...
D: It can seem daunting now, Monica, but it greatly improves quality of life long-term and builds muscle strength essential in MS management. We’ll tailor a plan that suits your schedule.
P: Alright... I'll do what needs doing. But listen—if this doesn’t work out, please don't take the usual non-compliance road just because my sarcasm might sneak into our conversations.
D: Monica, trust me; we want to make sure you get the best treatment without forcing anything. Your feedback is crucial for us to adjust in real-time if needed.
P: Glad to hear that. And hey—any chance of an earlier appointment slot? I mean, no complaints here but... less sitting around would mean more shooting photos and being productive!
D: Of course! We’ll do our best to schedule you at a time that’s convenient for your routine.

gpt-4.1-mini,,"P: Hey, doc. Thanks for seeing me again. I’ve been feeling that usual autumn slump creeping back—mood’s dipping, energy is low, and honestly, motivation’s been kinda scarce. Guess the SAD stuff is kicking in. 
D: Hi Jaylen, it’s good to see you again. I’m sorry to hear the seasonal blues have started early. How have you been managing with the light therapy and any other strategies we discussed last year? 
P: Well, I’ve kept up with the light box sessions almost daily, mostly in the mornings before heading out. It’s helped, but this year I’m wondering if maybe I should tweak the timing or intensity. The usual routine feels a bit less effective lately. 
D: That’s a good observation. Sometimes the effectiveness of light therapy changes depending on various factors—like how early you start or if the device needs replacing. Are you still using the same light box as last year? 
P: Yeah, same one. It’s a pretty basic model, nothing fancy or medical-grade. I didn’t know there was a big difference. Should I consider getting a higher-end one? 
D: It might be worth it. Devices vary in brightness, UV filtering, and overall quality. For SAD, we usually recommend a lamp that's at least 10,000 lux. Have you noticed any side effects like headaches or eye strain? 
P: Not really headaches, but sometimes my eyes feel a little tired if I stare too long. Maybe I’m sitting too close or using it too long? I usually do about 30 minutes. 
D: That duration is typical. You could try sitting a bit further back or repositioning the light to reduce eye strain. Also, consistency helps—the best results come when therapy is daily during the darker months. 
P: That makes sense. I guess with school starting back, my schedule's been all over the place. I’m taking urban ecology classes, which I like, but some mornings I just want to binge on music and plants instead of facing the day. 
D: That sounds challenging but also like you’re in tune with what you enjoy. Sometimes low motivation is part of the seasonal effect—but we can also explore other tools. Have you tried combining light therapy with any behavioral strategies? 
P: Not really structured ones. I mean, I do tend to get outside with my camera when I can—capturing city stuff, street art, those little alive moments. It kind of helps, but some days it feels like wading through fog. 
D: That’s an excellent coping method—getting outside, even briefly, exposes you to natural light and gives your mind a break. What about your sleep—how’s your routine these days? 
P: Sleep’s been on-again, off-again. Some nights I crash early, others I’m up late watching videos or editing photos. I know irregular sleep can mess with mood, but it’s tough to get consistent when motivation’s low. 
D: Understood. Establishing a regular sleep schedule can really improve your symptoms. Going to bed and waking up at the same time—even on weekends—helps stabilize your internal clock. 
P: Okay, I can try that. It’s just hard when my thoughts get loud and I second-guess the path I’m on. Sometimes I feel stuck between my past beliefs and where I am now—like, who even am I supposed to be? 
D: Jaylen, that’s a profound place to be. These feelings often intertwine with mood disorders. Therapy might be helpful—not just for SAD symptoms but also for supporting your emotional and existential reflections. 
P: I’ve never done talk therapy, but I’m open to it. Sometimes having an objective listener would be good. I tend to bottle things up until they burst. 
D: That’s very common, and therapy can provide a safe space for those conversations. I can help connect you with someone experienced in these areas. In the meantime, continuing light therapy, improving sleep, and keeping up with your passions sounds like a solid plan. 
P: Yeah, focusing on the little joys is important. Like noticing a perfectly cracked sidewalk or a resilient houseplant. Those things ground me when bigger currents get overwhelming. 
D: Exactly. Let’s also set up a follow-up in a few weeks to see how these adjustments are working for you. If symptoms worsen or if you feel interest or energy fail entirely, let me know sooner. 
P: Will do. Thanks for this—talking it through helps. I’ll be honest about how it goes and try not to get too lost in the gray. 
D: You’re doing a great job managing, Jaylen. Keep that gentle perspective with yourself. We’re in this together. 
P: Appreciate that. Alright, I’ll get on setting the alarm for regular sleep and check options for the light box. Catch you in a few weeks. 
D: Sounds good. Take care of yourself until then.

gpt-4.1,,"P: Good morning, Dr. Chen. Thanks for fitting me in today—I know it’s a busy time of year.
D: Good morning, Karen! Always happy to see you. How are you feeling since our last visit? Any changes to your symptoms?
P: It's been a bit up and down, to be honest. The fatigue is persistent—by Wednesday, I sort of feel like a phone at 10 percent battery. I do what I can, but it hits in the late afternoons, even if I get a full night's sleep. 
D: I see. And your weight—how’s that been recently?
P: Well, I was hoping you wouldn’t notice, but yes, I’ve gained about four pounds since March, even though my eating habits haven’t really changed. Rick jokes that I must be hiding cookies somewhere, but frankly, most of my baking goes to neighbors. I’ve even been walking the dog more, so I’m a little frustrated.
D: I'm glad you’re paying such close attention—that’s helpful. Any other symptoms? Changes in mood, skin, hair, or anything else?
P: My hair's thinner than I’d like, but nothing dramatic. Mood-wise, nothing major—just a little more irritable when work is hectic. Oh, and I’m having trouble focusing. Not sure if that’s stress or the thyroid. I did spill a saucepan of béarnaise last week, which is a capital offense in my kitchen.
D: Sorry to hear about the béarnaise—kitchen disasters aside, trouble concentrating can be related. How have you been sleeping?
P: Sleep is all right most nights—around seven hours. I wake up at least once or twice, but I drift back off. If I have a deadline coming up, my brain likes to remind me about the spreadsheet I need to finish, but that's normal for me.
D: Got it. Anything new—palpitations, constipation, or joint pain?
P: Constipation’s more frequent lately, yes. No heart issues. A few aches first thing in the morning, but gardening season has started, so that might be operator error. 
D: Understood. Are you still taking your levothyroxine as prescribed? Any missed doses?
P: I’m religious with it. Alarm on my phone and everything. I don’t always remember what I ate for lunch, but I don’t mess around with my meds. Though I do wonder if the dose is quite right—it just feels off.
D: Good. We’ll definitely check your bloodwork. Is there anything specific you’d like us to address today?
P: Mainly the fatigue and weight stuff—it’s hard not to feel like I’m missing a piece of the puzzle. At work, I can sort out a messy spreadsheet, but with my body, it feels like I’m chasing numbers and always coming up short. Any tips or tricks you have, I’m all ears.
D: Absolutely, we’ll look at everything. We may need to fine-tune your dosage. If it’s not the thyroid, we’ll explore other possibilities. Are you still up for regular walks and your cooking adventures?
P: Oh yes, I won’t let a sluggish thyroid take béarnaise off the table. But the walks are less brisk if I’m honest. Still, Rick tries to race me down the driveway, so there’s some motivation.
D: That’s wonderful—staying active helps. Let’s get the bloodwork done today. I’ll also send a referral for a dietitian if you want to discuss nutrition changes.
P: That’d be good, thank you. Maybe someone can teach me how to love kale. I’ve made peace with quinoa, so anything’s possible.
D: I’m optimistic! I’ll call you once the results are in. In the meantime, don’t be too hard on yourself—your diligence really makes a difference.
P: Thanks, Dr. Chen. I’ll keep tracking as best I can. And if you need a new banana bread recipe, just let me know.
D: I might hold you to that! Take care, Karen.

P: Honestly? Tougher than I expected. My mood's been really low lately. I've been struggling to get out of bed, which is weird for me 'cause I love mornings. But it's like I just wanna curl up with a book and hide from the world or something.
D: I see. That sounds like a classic case of SAD symptoms resurfacing. Have you been keeping up with your light therapy?
P: Yeah, I have, but it doesn't seem to be doing as much for me this year. Or maybe it's just the stress of classes on top of everything. I don't know. It feels like my motivation's just dwindling, you know?
D: That's understandable. We might need to make some adjustments to your light therapy schedule or the type of light you're using. Have you noticed any changes in your energy levels when you're doing things you enjoy, like photography?

qwen2.5:14b,,"P: Good afternoon. I'm here to see Dr. Thompson about my headaches.
D: Hello, Mr. Meyer. Please come in and take a seat. How are you feeling today?
P: Not great, actually. The past few weeks have been quite challenging with these headaches. They're becoming more frequent and intense, particularly after long periods at the computer.
D: I see. Can you tell me a bit about what triggers them? Are there any patterns or common factors that precede your headache episodes?
P: It seems to happen most when I'm deep in research work or during those late nights trying to figure out one of my chess puzzles. There’s also this sense of never feeling quite 'good enough,' which doesn’t help.
D: That's a pretty common experience, even among high achievers like yourself. Have you noticed any specific physical sensations before the headaches come on?
P: I usually feel very tense around my neck and shoulders first. Sometimes it’s hard to relax physically when so much is going on mentally too.
D: It sounds like stress management might be a good starting point for you, in addition to some physical interventions we can discuss today. Let's start with your current medication regimen—do you take any over-the-counter pain relievers or anything prescribed?
P: I’ve tried ibuprofen sporadically but haven't found it particularly effective in the long run.
D: Okay, let’s explore other options then. Are you open to trying some non-pharmacological approaches such as massage therapy or acupuncture? They can help relieve tension and manage pain without medication in many cases.
P: I'm open to anything that may offer relief and prevent these headaches from becoming worse. What would you recommend for managing them on an ongoing basis?
D: We might consider adding regular relaxation exercises or even a mindfulness-based stress reduction program to your routine. Additionally, we can look at ergonomic adjustments to help alleviate physical strain while working.
P: That seems promising. I’ve read about the benefits of certain supplements too— magnesium has come up quite often in my research on headache management.
D: Magnesium can be helpful for some people with tension headaches. We could try it alongside a therapeutic approach tailored specifically to your needs.
P: Sounds reasonable, though I will admit I sometimes struggle balancing all these additional steps along with daily tasks and work commitments.
D: That's understandable. Finding the right balance is key. Let’s create a step-by-step plan that fits into your routine without overwhelming you further. We can start small, perhaps with just fifteen minutes of relaxation exercises each day, gradually building as you become more comfortable.
P: I appreciate the thoughtful approach. Would it be useful for me to keep a journal detailing my daily habits and any changes in headache frequency?
D: Definitely. This will give us critical insights into potential triggers or improvements over time. It’s also a good practice for self-awareness and understanding your own body's signals better.
P: Alright, I’ll do that. Thank you, Dr. Thompson. Let's aim to tackle this from multiple angles then.
D: Exactly. We’re in this together, Elliot. Take it one step at a time and let’s see how things evolve over the next few weeks.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Hi, Doc! Thanks for seeing me today. I’ve been a little, um, wheezy after running around in soccer, and I wanna make sure everything’s okay. 
D: Hello, Ethan! I’m glad you came in for your check-up. Those episodes of wheezing—when did they start happening? 
P: It’s mostly been after I score a goal and start jumping around super excited. Like, I breathe fine at first, but then I cough and my chest feels tight. Yesterday, I even had to stop playing for a little. 
D: I see. That sounds uncomfortable. Have you noticed if it happens more on certain days or during particular activities besides soccer? 
P: Well, it’s mostly after I run a lot, especially if it’s hot outside or if I’ve been really toasty from the game. Oh, and sometimes I get a little wheezy when I laugh really hard. 
D: That’s important to tell me. Has the wheezing or coughing kept you from finishing your game or playing with your friends? 
P: Yeah! Sometimes I have to sit out because I feel like I can’t breathe good enough. It's kind of frustrating. 
D: It’s understandable. Do you use your inhaler when this happens, or do you just try to rest and hope it goes away? 
P: I have an inhaler, but I don’t always remember to use it unless I really need to. I mean, I don’t want to bother my parents all the time. 
D: Well, Ethan, it’s good that you have your inhaler. We might talk about how often you should use it, especially before playing so you can stay comfortable. Do you feel any pain or discomfort in your chest besides wheezing? 
P: Sometimes, yeah. Like, it feels really tight, kinda like when I try to squeeze into my spaceship Lego set and I can’t get the pieces to fit. 
D: Great comparison! That tightness can be caused by your asthma, and I want to make sure you’re managing it well. Do you remember about avoiding things that can trigger your asthma, like dust or smoke? 
P: Yeah, my mom keeps telling me to stay away from smoke and to keep away from dusty places. But I forget sometimes when I get caught up in my superhero stories. 
D: That’s okay, Ethan. We’ll make sure you understand how to keep yourself safe, and I might suggest some adjustments to your medication if needed. Also, if you ever feel really short of breath or things get worse, tell someone right away. 
P: I promise. I don’t wanna feel like I’m missing out on all the fun. I love playing outside and running around, but I just wanna stay healthy, too. 
D: That’s a great attitude. We’ll work together to keep those wheezing episodes under control so you can keep having your adventures without worry. Do you have any questions for me? 
P: Umm… yeah! Can I still play soccer even if I have asthma? Like, will I be the fastest one? 
D: Absolutely, Ethan! Playing soccer is still a fantastic idea. With the right management and maybe a quick puff of your inhaler beforehand, you can be just as fast and just as brave as always.

qwen2.5:14b,,"P: Dr. Lee, hi! It’s good to see you again!
D: Hello Malachi! How are you today? Are you excited about your visit?
P: Yeah, I guess so. But my tummy hurts sometimes in the morning when it's time for preschool.
D: Oh, that sounds tough, sweetie. Tell me more about how your tummy feels.
P: It’s like butterflies but not fun ones. You know, like those little wiggles inside?
D: That does sound uncomfortable. Do you ever feel better after snack or playtime at school?
P: A little bit, I think. But I still worry it might hurt again tomorrow.
D: We’ll talk about how we can make mornings and transitions easier for you. Does drawing or coloring help when your tummy hurts?
P: Yeah, that’s nice but not as good as mom reading my dinosaur books to me while I draw.
D: That sounds super soothing! Can your mom or dad do that more often before school?
P: They try, but sometimes they have meetings and can’t stay long. It makes me sad.
D: We’ll figure out some other ways for your parents to help you feel better too. Do you ever notice what triggers the pain—like being hungry or thirsty?
P: I don't know, it’s probably confusing because it happens when I’m thinking about going somewhere new.
D: That’s okay! Your tummy might just be extra sensitive right now, and that can happen without a specific reason we can find in tests. It doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with you though.
P: Okay… Do you think I should bring snacks to school every day?
D: That could help, but also focusing on calm breathing exercises or playing your favorite game might make it easier for your tummy too.
P: Really? Like when my cat is stressed and I pet her softly?
D: Exactly! Gentle touches and nice slow breaths can be very comforting. Let’s teach you some relaxation techniques.
P: Okay, that sounds fun! Can we draw pictures of calm tummies like Mr. Dinosaur here?
D: Absolutely! We’ll make it a game for you to remember at home too. Does your tummy ever hurt during bedtime or naptime?
P: Sometimes just before bedtime if my parents are not around.
D: That’s understandable. A special night light, perhaps one shaped as an animal? Or maybe listening to lullabies together could help calm your mind and body down.
P: That sounds nice! Our neighbor has some cool dinosaur ones… Maybe I’ll ask her for a visit too!
D: Great idea! Including time with friends or family who make you feel safe can be really helpful. We’re going to keep an eye on this, but it doesn't sound like anything serious at the moment.
P: Okay, thank you, Dr. Lee. Can we play some games here about my tummy now?
D: Of course! Let’s go grab your coloring books and start right away.

gpt-5-mini,high,"P: Good morning, Doctor. I'm Terrence Martin — I track my headaches and they're getting worse. I brought my logs.
D: Good morning, Terrence. Tell me what ""worse"" looks like — when did this change, and how often are you having headaches now?
P: They started about 18 months ago, infrequent at first. For most of last year I averaged roughly two migraine days per month. In the last three months that's jumped to somewhere between eight and twelve days per month. Intensity's increased too — most episodes are a 7–8 out of 10 and will last 12–24 hours.
D: That's a notable increase. Describe the pain and associated symptoms — location, quality, nausea, sensitivity to light or sound, any aura?
P: Usually unilateral, more on the left, throbbing. I get photophobia and phonophobia, fairly severe nausea, and once or twice I've vomited. I sometimes get a visual aura — wavy, scintillating zigzags about 10–15 minutes before the pain starts. No weakness, no slurred speech, no loss of consciousness.
D: Any recent head trauma, fevers, stiff neck, or any instance of a sudden ""worst headache of my life""?
P: No trauma, no fevers, no stiff neck, and none of those explosive-onset headaches. They tend to build over an hour or so and often follow late nights or long stretches at a screen.
D: What are you taking for the pain when these occur? Any prescription meds, OTCs, or other substances? How frequently per month?
P: I've been using ibuprofen, 400–600 mg, and occasionally acetaminophen. Over the last three months I've been taking something for about 12–15 days each month. I've not been on triptans or other prescription migraine meds.
D: Regular use at that frequency raises concern for medication-overuse headache. Do the OTCs help, short and long term?
P: They help short term; first dose brings relief, but pain often returns. Feels like I'm chasing the pain.
D: Any other substances — recreational drugs, nicotine, or heavy alcohol use? And how about caffeine?
P: No smoking, no recreational drugs. Alcohol is occasional. Caffeine is an issue — I drink coffee, usually three cups a day, sometimes more during late-night writing sessions.
D: Any family history of migraine or neurologic disease?
P: My uncle and my mother had migraines. So yes, some family history.
D: Have the headaches been interfering with your work or daily activities?
P: Significantly. When I'm fogged I can't read dense articles, write, or edit manuscripts reliably. Grant deadlines pile up. It feeds this imposter syndrome — I'm worried colleagues will think I can't deliver.
D: I understand. We'll aim to reduce frequency and protect your cognitive function. I'm going to do a quick neurologic exam unless you prefer to skip it.
P: Please do — I prefer objective data.
D: Cranial nerves II–XII intact. Strength 5/5, coordination normal, sensation intact. Gait normal. No focal deficits.
P: Good to hear.
D: Given your history — typical migraine features, occasional visual aura, and a recent increase in frequency plus regular analgesic use — two issues stand out: probable medication-overuse contribution and the need for preventive therapy. I also recommend an MRI of the brain because of the relatively rapid change in pattern. It's precautionary. Any questions about imaging?
P: Why MRI now if there aren't red flags?
D: A sudden change in frequency and severity justifies imaging to exclude structural causes. It's not because I suspect something alarming, but it's a prudent check. It won't delay treatment; we'll start therapy now.
P: Okay. What should we start with? I can't risk anything that fogs my thinking.
D: For acute attacks, I recommend a triptan — sumatriptan 50–100 mg at onset — combined with naproxen 500 mg. That combo is often more effective than either alone. Use no more than two doses in 24 hours and keep triptan use under 10 days per month to avoid overuse. For nausea, metoclopramide 10 mg can help.
P: I haven't used triptans. Any cardiovascular risk at 25?
D: At your age with a normal exam and no cardiac history, the risk is very low. We'll check blood pressure and heart rate now for baseline.
P: Good.
D: Regarding prevention: because you're having 8–12 migraine days a month and it's disabling, preventive therapy is indicated. Oral options include topiramate, propranolol, and amitriptyline. Topiramate is effective but often causes cognitive slowing and word-finding difficulty — which you explicitly want to avoid. Propranolol can cause fatigue or lightheadedness and is not ideal if you have asthma. Amitriptyline is sedating and has anticholinergic effects.
P: I don't want topiramate. Cognitive side effects would be a deal-breaker for me.
D: Understood. There's another class — CGRP monoclonal antibodies . They are well tolerated, have minimal cognitive side effects, and are effective at reducing monthly migraine days. They are injectable monthly or quarterly.
P: I'm familiar with the literature; they look promising. My concern is cost — I'm on grant-funded projects and not a full-time salary.
D: That is a common concern. Insurance often requires trials of oral preventives first, but with your documented disability and probable medication overuse, we can make a strong case for authorization. There are manufacturer assistance programs too. I'll start the prior authorization and help with paperwork.
P: I'd appreciate that. Preserving cognition matters more than the sticker price.
D: Noted. In the meantime, we should work on lifestyle: consistent sleep schedule , limit caffeine to under ~200 mg a day, avoid skipping meals, stay hydrated, and consider earplugs at concerts if loud music triggers you. Keep your headache log — your data will be critical for preauth.
P: I already log timestamps, severity, triggers — it's basically a spreadsheet with timestamps and notes. I can export and send that.
D: That will be very helpful. Also, we need to address the analgesic pattern — taper toward fewer than 15 days per month for simple analgesics and fewer than 10 days for triptans. Sudden withdrawal can be unpleasant; we'll do a planned taper and consider starting preventive therapy concurrently. If you have a cluster of refractory headaches during withdrawal, we can consider a short steroid taper as a bridge, but evidence is mixed.
P: I'd rather avoid steroids unless necessary. What's your preferred strategy to break the cycle?
D: Start the triptan-plus-naproxen for acute attacks, initiate the prior authorization for a CGRP agent given your cognitive concerns, begin a controlled analgesic taper, and reinforce lifestyle measures. If analgesic overuse is severe and you fail initial measures, we can consider additional support like brief steroid bridging or a neurology headache clinic referral.
P: If we have to try an oral preventive while waiting for authorization, what's least likely to impact cognition?
D: Propranolol can be an option; it doesn't typically cause cognitive blunting, though it can cause fatigue. Candesartan is another oral option with data supporting efficacy and fewer cognitive effects. We can choose based on your baseline vitals and comorbidities.
P: I cycle across the city daily. Is it safe to keep riding? Sometimes exercise does trigger a headache.
D: Regular aerobic exercise is generally beneficial for migraine prevention long-term. If intense rides acutely trigger an attack, consider adjusting intensity or timing, and be sure to hydrate and fuel adequately. Triptans are safe to use for acute migraines while you continue to cycle otherwise.
P: One more thing — the imposter-syndrome angle. If I can't meet deadlines while we get this under control, can you document that medically?
D: Absolutely. I can provide a clinical note summarizing the diagnosis, current functional impact, and expected timeline for treatment response to support accommodations with your advisor or institution.
P: That would ease some of the stress. Thank you.
D: You're welcome. To summarize the plan: I'll order MRI brain; start sumatriptan 50–100 mg at onset plus naproxen 500 mg for acute attacks and metoclopramide for nausea PRN; begin a controlled taper of OTC analgesics; initiate prior authorization for a CGRP monoclonal antibody given your cognitive concerns; implement lifestyle modifications; and follow up in six weeks to assess response. If you can't wait, come in sooner.
P: Sounds good. How soon might the CGRP work if approved?
D: Some patients notice improvement within one month; more commonly benefits become clearer by two to three months. We'll reassess at six weeks and again at three months.
P: Okay. If insurance denies it, we'll pursue propranolol or candesartan, but no topiramate. Agreed?
D: Agreed. We'll avoid topiramate given your priorities. I'll get the MRI ordered and start the prior authorization paperwork. Also, I'll check your blood pressure and heart rate now.
P: BP's usually fine at home, but go ahead.
D: Blood pressure and heart rate are within normal limits. I'll place the MRI order and submit the authorization. Office staff will help you with scheduling and paperwork. Keep your headache log and limit OTC use as we discussed. If you develop new focal neurologic signs, sudden severe headache, fever, or progressive worsening, come in or go to the ER.
P: Thank you — really. I'll export that spreadsheet and bring it next time. I want my late-night jazz and my grant writing back.
D: We'll work to get you there. See you in six weeks or sooner if needed.

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Hey there, Dr. Patel! I’m Ethan Martinez, a 10-year-old who loves video games, dancing, and goofy stories with my siblings.
D: Hi Ethan, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Patel. I hear you’ve had more wheezing during play recently. Can you tell me what happened?
P: Sure. Yesterday in gym I started wheezing hard, my chest felt tight, and I could barely finish a sentence. I had to sit down and slow my breathing.
D: That sounds scary. How often has this been happening?
P: It’s happened 2–3 times this week, mostly when I run or go up stairs. I use my rescue inhaler at home, and it helps a bit, but I still feel winded after.
D: Do you have your rescue inhaler with you today? And are you able to use it properly if I watch?
P: I have one at home and try to bring it to school, but I forget sometimes. I can use it okay when I remember, though I tend to talk fast and lose focus.
D: No worries—we’ll make sure you have it where you need it and that you know how to use it.
P: I love dancing to K-pop and making goofy group dances with my two younger siblings. I don’t want asthma to stop me from dancing or playing.
D: Dancing is great exercise. We’ll keep your airways open so you can keep moving.
P: Also, group projects at school can be a lot and make me a little overwhelmed. When that happens I feel my breathing get heavy.
D: Stress and crowds can affect asthma. We’ll plan for doing school activities safely.
P: My family is mixed—music and songs from both sides of our heritage. We learn simple songs and dance steps during family gatherings.
D: That’s wonderful. Staying active with family traditions can help you stay on top of your asthma.
P: The last couple of weeks I’ve wheezed more when I’m outside at recess. I’m worried I’ll miss gym or after-school practice if this keeps up.
D: I hear you. Let’s check how controlled your asthma is and decide if we need to adjust anything.
P: Do I have to take medicine every day, or only when I feel wheezy?
D: It depends on control. Some kids use a daily inhaled controller if symptoms are more than a couple times a week. We’ll review your breathing and talk about options.
P: If I start daily meds, will I still be able to run and dance?
D: Yes. The goal is to reduce inflammation so you can stay active. We’ll tailor a plan for sports, school, and home.
P: Can you show me again how to use the inhaler?
D: Of course. I’ll walk you through each step and you can practice.
P: What about cold air? Sometimes it hurts my breathing when it’s chilly outside.
D: Cold air can trigger symptoms for some kids. We’ll suggest a light warm-up, a scarf or mask, and maybe keeping outdoor time shorter on very cold days.
P: Will we do tests today to check my lungs?
D: We’ll listen to your lungs with the stethoscope, check your breathing, and we can do a quick peak flow test. If we need more information, we can schedule spirometry.
P: Thanks, Dr. Patel. I’m glad we’re figuring this out.
D: You’re doing great, Ethan. We’ll write up an asthma action plan with your family and keep you dancing.

gpt-5,high,"P: Morning, Doc.
D: Good morning, Dennis. How’ve you been breathing since our last visit?
P: Better some days, not so hot others. The garden’s got me puffing more than it used to. Carrying a bucket of mulch feels like I ran a sprint.
D: How often is the shortness of breath happening with activity now?
P: Most days, to be honest. Ten minutes in, I’m taking a pause. Heat makes it worse. Bending over to weed is the kicker.
D: Any cough, wheeze, or mucus changes?
P: A little morning wheeze. Cough’s there, but it’s dry. Got a chest cold back in January—cleared after a Z-pack from urgent care.
D: Any ER visits or steroids this year?
P: No ER. Just that antibiotic. They talked steroids; I said I’d rather not unless I had to.
D: What inhalers are you using now?
P: I’ve got the blue rescue one—albuterol. I use it before I head outside and sometimes once or twice more if I’m pushing it. On mowing days, maybe three, four times.
D: Any daily controller inhaler?
P: No ma’am. Just the blue one. I don’t love the idea of getting tied to more meds.
D: I hear you. Your oxygen today is 95% at rest, lungs with some scattered wheeze. Your last breathing test showed moderate COPD. Given how often you need albuterol, I’d recommend adding a once-daily maintenance inhaler to open the airways all day—something like a LAMA/LABA combination. It reduces symptoms and the need for the rescue inhaler.
P: If it helps me stay in the dirt and out of your office, I’ll give it a fair shot. Which one?
D: Options include tiotropium/olodaterol or umeclidinium/vilanterol. We’ll choose one your insurance covers. You’ll still keep albuterol for flare-ups.
P: Alright. Show me how to use it right. Sandra says I rush it.
D: Good point. With the rescue inhaler, slow deep breath while you press, then hold 10 seconds. A spacer helps—want one?
P: Yep. I’ll use it if it makes the darn thing work better.
D: Great. And I’d like to refer you to pulmonary rehab. It’s a supervised program—breathing techniques, strength and endurance work. People with COPD often walk farther with less breathlessness after a few weeks.
P: Sounds like boot camp for lungs. I’m not big on group stuff, but if it means I can keep wrenching on my Chevy, I’ll try it. Mornings are best.
D: We’ll schedule morning sessions. For the garden, pace yourself: work 5–7 minutes, rest 2–3 with pursed-lip breathing. Use a rolling stool or raised beds to avoid bending. Keep tools close, and avoid the midday heat.
P: I can live with that. I’ve been stubborn, trying to power through. Doesn’t end well.
D: Also wear an N95 when you’re kicking up dust, mulch, or when sanding in the garage. Triggers matter.
P: Fair. I’ve got a box in the truck from the volunteer day.
D: Any nighttime symptoms? Waking short of breath or snoring that Sandra’s noticed?
P: She says I snore like a freight train. I don’t wake gasping, but I do nap more than I used to.
D: If daytime sleepiness persists, we can evaluate for sleep apnea later. For now, let’s focus on COPD control. How’s weight and appetite?
P: Steady. Sandra feeds me too well. Those pies are trouble.
D: Smaller, more frequent meals can help—big meals press up on the diaphragm. Sip water, not ice-cold, when you’re short of breath.
P: Got it.
D: Vaccines: have you had your flu shot this season?
P: Yep. Got it at the pharmacy. COVID booster too. Pneumonia shot… I think at 65? Not sure which. No RSV.
D: We can give you the one-time PCV20 pneumonia vaccine today if you haven’t had it, and the RSV vaccine is recommended for folks your age with COPD. Both reduce lung infections that set people back.
P: I don’t love being a pincushion, but “one-and-done” I can handle. Let’s do the pneumonia one. I’ll think on the RSV, but I’m leaning yes.
D: Sounds good. I’ll print info on RSV for you. Quick check—how often do you feel anxious with the breathlessness?
P: I wouldn’t call it anxious. More irritated. I like to finish what I start.
D: Understandable. When it ramps up, stop, lean forward on a counter or knees, and do slow in-through-the-nose, out-through-pursed-lips breathing for a minute. It works.
P: I’ll practice that.
D: I’d also like to repeat spirometry in the next month to see where you are now. Okay?
P: Book it.
D: One more thing: action plan. If you have a noticeable increase in breathlessness plus more cough or greenish mucus, or fever, start albuterol every 4 hours as needed, rest, and call us the same day. For someone as reliable as you, I can provide a “rescue pack” of prednisone and an antibiotic with strict instructions. Use only if we discuss or if it’s after hours and you meet those criteria.
P: I won’t abuse it. I like a plan.
D: Excellent. Any concerns about oxygen? Some folks worry when they hear “COPD.”
P: I’d rather not be tethered to a tank. Am I headed there?
D: Not today. Your numbers don’t warrant oxygen. We’ll do a 6-minute walk test—if your oxygen drops below 88% with exertion, we’d reconsider. Otherwise, the new inhaler and rehab should help.
P: Good to hear.
D: Meds summary: start the LAMA/LABA once daily, spacer with albuterol, keep the rescue inhaler for flares. Pulmonary rehab referral, masks for dusty work, pacing and breathing strategies, vaccine today, consider RSV, schedule spirometry and a 6-week follow-up to see how you’re doing.
P: That’s a solid playbook. I’ll do my part.
D: I know you will. Anything else on your mind?
P: Just want to keep up with my grandkids and get that ’68 Chevy purring without wheezing more than the engine. Help me do that, Doc.
D: That’s the goal. We’ll get you there. I’ll send in the prescriptions and have the nurse go over inhaler technique before you leave.
P: Appreciate you. Tell the nurse I’m ready to learn—then I’ve got tomatoes to stake before it gets too hot.

gpt-4.1-mini,,"P: Good afternoon, Doctor. I've been looking forward to our follow-up. Honestly, the migraines have started to feel like an uninvited guest that just won’t leave. Lately, the frequency has ramped up, and it’s cutting deep into my lab time and the late-night writing sessions I rely on.
D: I’m sorry to hear that, Terrence. Can you describe how often these migraines have been occurring recently and if the severity has changed compared to before?
P: Sure thing. Previously, they were maybe once a week, manageable with some ibuprofen and a dark room. But now, it’s more like three or four times a week, sometimes lasting up to eight hours. The pain itself—it’s this throbbing, pulsing kind of pressure, mostly around my temples and behind my eyes. It really just zaps all my focus and energy.
D: That sounds challenging, especially given your demanding research schedule. Have you noticed any particular triggers or patterns that coincide with these migraine episodes?
P: That’s something I’ve been trying to map out. Stress is an obvious suspect—late nights, tight deadlines, the usual grind. But I also wonder about my diet and hydration. Sometimes I’m so caught up in data and community meetings that I forget to eat regularly or drink enough water. Bright lights in the lab and noise don’t help, either. It’s a perfect storm.
D: How have you been managing the migraines when they start? Any medications or lifestyle adjustments?
P: Mostly over-the-counter stuff like acetaminophen or ibuprofen, but I’m wary of overuse. I’ve tried scheduling breaks and meditation, but when a deadline looms, I find it hard to step back. I’m interested in exploring preventive options, maybe something that could keep my head clear without compromising my day-to-day.
D: That makes sense. We have a few preventive strategies to discuss. Also, have you experienced any new symptoms, like visual disturbances, nausea, or sensitivity to sound or smell during these attacks?
P: Yes, definitely sensitivity to light and sound—it’s like everything amplifies. Nausea crops up sometimes too, though not all the time. No aura or visual flashes, if that’s what you’re asking. I keep notes on these episodes; data helps me stay grounded when the migraine fog rolls in.
D: Your note-taking will be very helpful. Based on what you’ve described, I’d like to consider both pharmacologic and non-pharmacologic preventive treatments. We might start with a low-dose beta-blocker or a calcium channel blocker. Would you be open to that?
P: It sounds like a worthwhile approach. I prefer something that won’t cloud my cognitive abilities, given how crucial clarity is in my work. I guess my main hope is finding balance—managing the migraines without sacrificing the intellectual edge.
D: Absolutely, that’s a priority. We’ll monitor how you respond to any medication closely. I’ll also suggest some lifestyle modifications like consistent meal times, hydration, and regular sleep patterns. Have you tried any physical activities like cycling recently? That can sometimes relieve stress and reduce migraine frequency.
P: Actually, yes. I’ve been cycling around the city a few times a week. It’s a refreshing escape, gives me a chance to clear my head and notice the shifting urban landscape. I’ll keep that up, maybe even make it more routine. The family always encourages me to take breaks, so this might be a perfect way to listen to them for once.
D: That sounds excellent. Support systems and lifestyle balance are just as important as medications. We’re going to work together to get things under control so your research and community engagement can thrive.
P: I appreciate that. It’s reassuring to know there’s a plan that respects both my health and my work. I’ll keep tracking everything and be honest when things shift. Thanks for taking the time to really listen; it means a lot.
D: You’re very welcome, Terrence. Let’s schedule a check-in in a few weeks to see how you’re progressing. Meanwhile, don’t hesitate to reach out if the migraines worsen or if you have any concerns.
P: Will do. Here’s to clearer days and quieter heads ahead. See you soon, Doctor.

gpt-4.1-mini,,"P: *bouncing a little in the chair* Hi! Guess what? I found a BIG mud puddle yesterday. It was so squishy! My dump truck got all muddy and stuck. It’s like a mess party! 
D: That sounds like quite the adventure, Oliver. Did you get dirty all over?
P: Yup! Mud on my boots, on my hands, even on my nose! Mommy said I have to be careful with my cough so the doctor can make it all go away ‘cause it keeps sticking around after all the sneezes I get.
D: Yes, I see. Your cough has been hanging on a bit longer than we’d like. How many days do you think you’ve had it this time?
P: Umm… lots. Like, more than the blocks I stacked yesterday. *grins* It won’t let me play the way I want 'cause sometimes I get a tickle, tickle and then I cough. It’s annoying. 
D: That tickle can be tricky, can’t it? Have you told your mom or dad when it starts?
P: Yeah! I say, “Mom! My cough monster’s back!” and she gives me the medicine that tastes yucky but helps a little. But I want to catch the cough monster, too! Like I catch raindrops with my hands.
D: Catching raindrops sounds fun—and tricky, just like catching a cough monster. Let’s listen to your chest and see how your lungs are doing. Can you take a big deep breath for me?
P: *takes a big breath and coughs a little* Like this? I tried to be super quiet but the cough wanted to come out.
D: That’s okay, Oliver, you did great! Your lungs are a bit noisy today, which is why you’re still coughing. Sometimes when you get sick, your airways get a little sensitive and take longer to heal, like a scraped knee.
P: Oh! So my lungs need a bandaid like my knee? I want one with a dinosaur on it. 
D: *laughs* That’s a great idea. While we don’t have a dinosaur bandaid for your lungs, the medicine you’re taking is helping them heal. We just need to make sure you rest lots and keep away from too much mud until you’re all better. 
P: But muddy adventures are the best adventures! Can I play in the mud a little? Maybe just a tiny splash? 
D: A tiny splash sounds fair, as long as you wash up really well afterward. And if you start coughing a lot again, you’ll have to tell your mom or dad so we can help you feel better again.
P: Okay! I promise. After mud, washing hands like a superhero! *makes superhero pose* 
D: Perfect, Super Oliver. We’ll keep you healthy and ready for all those big block towers and muddy discoveries. And if the cough sticks around too long, we might do some more tests to make sure everything is okay. Sound good?
P: Yeah! I like tests if they come with stickers. Can I have one?
D: Absolutely, stickers for brave explorers like you.
P: Yay! I’m gonna build a tower of stickers at home. Thanks, doctor! Now I feel ready to catch the cough monster next time it visits. 
D: You’re very welcome, Oliver. Keep being curious, and we’ll see you soon for a check-up. Stay strong and mud-safe!
P: Bye! I’m gonna tell my sister I saw the doctor and I’m a cough-monster catcher now! *giggles and wiggles out of the chair*

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Hi there, Doctor! We’re here because Jackson’s nose just keeps runnin’ like a river, and he’s sneezin’ all over the place. It’s been a couple weeks now, and I think it’s gotta be them allergies again, but we thought we’d check, just to be sure. 
D: Hello, Jackson! Hi, buddy. It’s nice to meet you. So, tell me, Jackson, what have you been up to lately? Still digging in the mud? 
P: Oh yeah, all the time! That’s my favorite. I made a super big road in the backyard, and I drove my trucks through puddles till they were all muddy and splishy. But now, my nose is all stuffy, and my eyes itch somethin’ fierce. 
D: It sounds like you’ve been having quite the adventure outside. And it sounds like these allergies are making you uncomfortable. Has your nose been stuffy all day or just when you’re outside playing? 
P: Mostly outside, but sometimes even inside! Like, I was watchin’ cartoons, and my nose just won’t stop runnin’. And my eyes are all red and itchy, just like I rubbed ’em too hard. 
D: I see. Jackson, allergies can cause sneezing, a runny nose, and itchy eyes, especially if you’re playing outside where there are things like pollen. Do you feel tired or sick at all? 
P: Nah, I still got my energy! I wanna go back outside and dig some more. But my mom says I gotta stay away from the dirt for a while. That’s the worst part! 
D: Well, Jackson, it’s good to hear you still have lots of energy. Sometimes, allergies make your eyes and nose sad, but we can help make you feel better with some medicine, and maybe your parents can help keep the pollen away. Do you wanna help me look at your nose and eyes now? 
P: Sure! But only if I get to see inside my own nose. I wanna know what it looks like when I sneeze. 
D: We’ll take a peek, don’t worry. I just want to make sure everything looks healthy. And we’ll talk about how to keep the itchies away.

Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct,,"P: Morning, Doctor. Sorry I'm a few minutes early. I guess I'm just eager to get the results.
D: Ah, no need to apologize, Karen. We're happy to have you in early. How've you been feeling lately?
P: Honestly? A bit drained. Still getting used to juggling my medication, trying to find that sweet spot. It's hard not to get frustrated when I'm tired all the time and can't even muster up the energy to cook a decent meal.
D: I understand. Fatigue is a common symptom of hypothyroidism. Have you noticed any changes in your weight since our last visit?
P: Yeah...I've put on a bit, unfortunately. It's like my metabolism just came to a grinding halt. I'm eating healthy, I think. Rick and I have been trying to cut back on road trip treats, but it doesn't seem to be making much difference.
D: I see. We'll take a look at your thyroid hormone levels and see if you need any adjustments to your medication. Can you tell me more about what a typical day looks like for you in terms of energy levels?
P: Well...I usually wake up feeling pretty okay, but by mid-morning, I'm already starting to flag. Mornings are my most productive time, so it's really discouraging when I can't power through like I used to.
D: And how about evenings? Do you get a second wind or do you find yourself winding down pretty early?
P: Actually, evenings are when I usually start to perk up again. Rick and I will be watching TV or talking, and I'll suddenly get this burst of energy and head into the kitchen to whip up something crazy. Of course, that only lasts for a little while, and then I'm crashing again...but it's nice while it lasts!
D: Sounds like you have a good support system in Rick. Now, let's take a look at your blood test results...
P: Okay, I'm ready.
D: Your T4 levels are looking a bit low, so I think we might need to tweak your medication. In the meantime, I want you to keep working on those healthy habits you mentioned. Try not to get too discouraged about the weight – we'll work on finding a solution.
P: Okay...thank you, Doctor. Just knowing what's going on helps, I think. Maybe I can try experimenting with some new recipes, see if I can find some tricks to boost my energy.
D: Sounds like a plan. And don't forget to enjoy those road trips with Rick – a happy life is just as important as a healthy one!
P: Will do, Doctor.

gpt-5-mini,low,"P: Good morning, Doctor. Thank you for fitting me in. I brought notes—short version: my knees are worse. Walking the arboretum is stiffer, and kneading pasta dough has become a negotiation.
D: Good morning, Ellen. I appreciate the notes. How long has this increase in pain and stiffness been going on?
P: It's been creeping up over the last six months, more noticeable in the past eight weeks. Morning stiffness lasts maybe 20 to 30 minutes now, and by the time I’m standing at the counter more than half an hour, the joint feels like an overused hinge.
D: Is the pain constant or does it come and go?
P: It fluctuates. Baseline ache most days, sharper pain with stairs or getting up from a low chair. Sitting at my desk all morning sometimes helps, but if I stand to cook longer than an hour I pay for it later.
D: Any swelling, warmth, or redness in the knees?
P: Slight swelling some evenings, not red or hot. More of a puffiness, like the joint is resentful.
D: Any locking, catching, or giving way?
P: No locking, but a few weeks ago one knee felt like it might give when I reached for a heavy pot—very unnerving. It didn't collapse, but it was a near-miss.
D: Any recent injuries or unusual activity?
P: Nothing acute. I did stand on a stool to reach a top shelf last month—felt a twinge—but nothing dramatic.
D: What treatments have you tried so far?
P: I’m on acetaminophen as needed—trying to keep NSAIDs low because of my stomach. I do low-impact walking and I tried one online strengthening routine, but I’m not consistent. I used a neoprene sleeve sometimes when I cook. I had a cortisone injection in the right knee about 15 months ago; it helped for maybe three months.
D: Any imaging—X-rays or MRI?
P: I had X-rays two years ago showing early osteoarthritis. My PCP documented that. No MRIs.
D: Any other medical history—heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, bleeding disorders?
P: Mild hypertension controlled with lisinopril, no diabetes. I take a baby aspirin occasionally; otherwise no bleeding issues.
D: Allergies?
P: Penicillin makes me break out, so I avoid it.
D: How is this affecting your life—work, cooking, faith community, social activities?
P: It’s beginning to intrude. I cut back on long recipe tests because I dread the aftermath. My Friday dinners have become shorter courses. I walk less far at the arboretum; I miss that quiet hour. I’m still attending the hall meetings for the local Democratic group but I sit more. It’s enough to be annoying and a bit demoralizing.
D: Understood. On exam I’ll check range of motion, crepitus, alignment, and stability. Therapeutically, we have several options—optimize strengthening and physical therapy, consider topical NSAIDs, oral NSAIDs if safe, hyaluronic or corticosteroid injections again, bracing, referral to orthopedics for possible surgical options if conservative care fails. Are there preferences or things you want to avoid?
P: I prefer to avoid surgery if possible. I’d like to be more consistent with noninvasive measures first. Steroid injections helped before, but it was temporary. I’m skeptical about daily oral NSAIDs long-term because of stomach and blood pressure concerns. Topical options interest me. I’m willing to try a structured PT program if it’s targeted—I'm very motivated when there’s a plan with measurable steps. Also, if the brace can let me knead dough again, I’ll consider it. I’m organized; give me benchmarks and I’ll follow them.
D: That’s reasonable. I can prescribe a 6–8 week course of physical therapy focused on quadriceps and hip strengthening and balance. We’ll set goals—improved 30-second chair-stand count and decreased pain with stair ascent. Topical diclofenac gel is a good option to try before systemic NSAIDs; minimal systemic absorption. Weight management can help, though you mentioned you’re upper-middle-class and active—I don’t want to make assumptions. Any interest in working with a dietitian if needed?
P: My weight is stable; I try to be sensible with food. I’d rather focus on strengthening and topical therapy first. I cook a lot, so a few simple joint-friendly adaptations in the kitchen would help—height adjustments, anti-fatigue mats. I like concrete steps.
D: Good. I’ll write the PT referral and the topical diclofenac prescription. If you’re open, we can consider a repeat corticosteroid injection for a flare, but spaced appropriately—generally no more than three to four times per year. Hyaluronic injections have mixed evidence but can be considered if injections are desired. If symptoms progress despite these measures, I’ll refer you to orthopedics to discuss imaging and potential surgical options.
P: If I return to you in eight weeks and it’s only marginally better, at what point would you send me to orthopedics?
D: If after 8–12 weeks of consistent PT and topical therapy your pain limits daily activities—cooking for over 30 minutes, walking less than a third of your usual distance, or you have recurrent instability—then we’d get updated X-rays and an ortho referral.
P: That timeline is acceptable. One more practical question: vaccines or labs to consider before injections?
D: I’ll check basic labs—CBC and BMP—given your antihypertensive and aspirin use to ensure no contraindications. No vaccine requirements for injections. If we opt for surgery later, we’d do a more thorough pre-op evaluation then.
P: Thank you. I like that plan. Can you also give me a simple home exercise sheet? I’ll schedule the PT and order the diclofenac.
D: Absolutely. I’ll print a starter exercise list for you and send the PT referral. I’ll also schedule a follow-up in eight weeks. Any other concerns?
P: Just that I want to keep my independence in the kitchen and the arboretum walks. Prayer helps, too. I appreciate directness—tell me if something is unlikely to work.
D: I will. We’ll proceed with PT, topical diclofenac, adaptive measures, and reassess in eight weeks. If needed, injections or orthopedics next.
P: Perfect. I’ll call to book PT and follow the exercise sheet. Thank you, Doctor.

gpt-5-mini,high,"P: Eeee! Doctor! Look—mud! My truck is all squishy mud—there's a tiny bug on it! Hee hee!
D: Hi Oliver, I'm Dr. Lee. That's an awesome dump truck—and very muddy. Are you here because you've been coughing a lot?
P: Yeah. I cough and cough after I get a cold. It won't go away and Mommy gets worried. It tickles here—.
D: That sounds annoying. Does the cough happen at night or when you run and play?
P: Both! At night it wakes Mommy up. And when I run to catch rain in my hands I cough and I can't finish my block tower and that makes me sad.
D: Do you ever make a wheezy, whistling sound when you breathe?
P: Sometimes it goes ""peeeeee"" like a little siren when I run fast. And when I laugh at my sister I cough too.
D: How many colds did you have this winter—lots of them?
P: Four? Maybe more. My sister says I bring home the messy. She helps me, and then she takes my blocks and I say ""noooo"" but I still love her.
D: Any fevers, throwing up, or weight loss? Can you still eat and play?
P: No fevers much. I still eat snacks. I play a lot—mud, bugs, trucks. I don't like when the cough makes me tired.
D: Does anyone smoke around the house? Any pets that shed lots of hair?
P: No smoke. We don't have a dog, just bugs in the yard. I like bugs. Mommy says no worms in the house.
D: Okay. I'm going to listen to your chest now. Can you sit on Mommy's lap and blow big like you're blowing out candles?
P: Blow big like bubble! Hee hee—I'm blowing!
D: Big breath in... and out. Good. Again—nice big breath.
P: It tickles! Is your stethoscope a tickle-monster?
D: It kind of is. I can hear a little wheeze when you breathe out—your airways sound a bit sensitive. That can happen after colds and is why you keep getting these coughy episodes—sometimes we call that recurrent bronchitis or reactive airways.
P: Recur-what? Does that mean my truck will cough too?
D: Nope—just your lungs. We can try something that helps open them so you can run and finish towers without coughing.
P: Like superhero spray? Can I have a superhero spray?
D: Yes—albuterol is like a quick superhero puff. I'm going to show you a spacer with a mask—it looks like a little rocket. Want to press the button?
P: Ooh yes! Can I press it? Eee! Rocket go!
D: Ready? Big breath in, press the button, then take five little breaths into the spacer like you're smelling a yummy flower. Good—one more.
P: I did it! It tickled my nose and I giggled. Will it make me zoom-zoom?
D: It will make it easier to breathe and less cough-y so you can zoom to the mud puddles and finish your block towers. It won't make you fly, though.
P: Okay. I like finishing towers. Can I still get dirty?
D: Absolutely—you can get as muddy as you like. We just want to help the cough so it doesn't keep bothering you.
P: Will I have to come back a lot? I like my cartoons and Mommy's lap.
D: We'll do a plan: I'll give a prescription for an albuterol inhaler and a spacer with a mask for when you cough or wheeze. If you need it a lot—more than once a week or waking at night—we'll think about a daily medicine to help keep your airways calm and may check for allergies. We'll also talk about getting the flu shot and using saline for a stuffy nose.
P: Will getting the spray hurt? I don't like shots but sprays are okay.
D: Sprays don't hurt. I'll show your parents exactly how to use it so it's easy for you.
P: Can my sister watch? She builds towers too and she laughs a lot.
D: Of course—sisters can be very helpful. We'll also ask your parents about any triggers like smoke or lots of pollen and keep an eye on fevers or fast breathing.
P: If the cough doesn't stop, do I get a big test? Like a pirate treasure test?
D: Maybe more tests if it keeps happening—sometimes we send kids to an allergy doctor or a pediatric lung specialist. But first we'll try the inhaler and some simple steps at home.
P: Like washing hands so I don't get more colds? I always wash so I can go outside!
D: Exactly—handwashing, avoiding smoke, and the flu vaccine help a lot. Use saline drops for a stuffy nose and the humidifier at night can help.
P: Okay. I'm brave. Can I press the rocket button again before we go? Hee hee!
D: Sure—one more puff for practice. Great job, Oliver. We'll call your mom with any results and see you back in a few weeks to make sure your towers stay standing and your cough goes away.
P: Yay! Thank you, Doctor! I gotta show my truck to my sister. Bye! Eee!

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Good morning, doctor. I appreciate you seeing me today. I’ve been having some more of those palpitations — quite a bit more frequent lately. It’s kind of unsettling, you know? 
D: Good morning, Walter. I understand how that can be concerning. Let’s go over your symptoms and see what we can do. How have you been feeling overall aside from the palpitations? 
P: Well, I’d say I’ve been a bit more sluggish than usual, especially in the afternoons. I’ve also noticed myself getting a little more anxious, which I suppose isn’t surprising given the situation. Marjorie says I’ve been more tense, too. 
D: It’s good you’re paying close attention to these changes. Anxiety and fatigue can sometimes be linked to atrial fibrillation episodes. Have you experienced any dizziness or lightheadedness? 
P: Yes, actually. A couple of times lately, I’ve felt a bit woozy if I stand up too quickly. It’s not frequent, but enough for me to notice. 
D: That’s important to note. We’ll want to check your heart rhythm and review your medication to ensure everything’s optimized. How are your current meds? Are you taking them as prescribed? 
P: Yes, I’ve been diligent. I don’t like to fuss with pills, but I understand their importance. I’ve stuck to the schedule. 
D: That’s excellent, Walter. It’s crucial to adhere strictly to your medication regimen, especially with atrial fibrillation. Have you, by chance, had any episodes of chest pain or shortness of breath? 
P: No chest pain, thankfully. I do get short of breath sometimes when I walk a brisk distance, but I chalked that up to needing to pace myself better. 
D: That’s reasonable. We’ll do an EKG today to get a clear picture of your heart’s rhythm and see if there are any adjustments needed. Do you have any worries about your prognosis or what might come next? 
P: Well, I’ve always tried to be practical about these things, but I won’t pretend I don’t worry a bit about the future. I think anyone in my shoes would. It’s the unpredictability that gets to me sometimes. 
D: Your concerns are very normal, Walter. We’re here to manage your condition as best as we can, and I’ll work with you on any adjustments needed. Remember, staying on top of these visits is part of that. It’s good to keep a watchful eye and maintain your routines. 
P: Thank you, doctor. I do find comfort in stability. And I trust you’ll guide me through whatever needs doing. I’d rather be cautious than overlook anything. 
D: Absolutely, Walter. We’ll take it step by step. After today’s tests, I’ll review everything and discuss the next steps. In the meantime, keep an eye on how you’re feeling, and don’t hesitate to call if anything changes suddenly. 
P: I will. Thank you again for your thoughtful care. Maybe I’ll go home and practice a bit of clarinet — it always helps me find my calm.

D: Good morning, Walter. It's good to see you again. How've you been feeling lately?
P: Honestly? A bit worn out. Palpitations seem to be getting worse. Had some trouble catching my breath doing yard work last weekend.
D: I see. Let's take a look at your chart and see how things are progressing with the atrial fibrillation. Have you noticed any other symptoms besides the palpitations and fatigue?
P: Well, there are times I get this sort of... uneasiness, I suppose, about what might be coming around the corner. Hard to shake the feeling sometimes.
D: I understand. Anxiety can certainly play a role in how we experience our physical health. We can discuss some potential strategies for managing that, but first, let me ask: have you been taking your medication as directed?
P: Oh, yes. Very diligent about it, in fact. Thirty years in the savings institution taught me to keep track of details. 
D: That's terrific. I do want to review your current regimen, though, as it's possible we might need to make some adjustments to better manage those palpitations.
P: I see. Will this... significantly alter my daily routine? Marjorie, my wife, and I try to stay active, what with the yard and our volunteering.

Perhaps a slight modification to your medication, and certainly continued monitoring to ensure we're staying on top of the afib. You've been managing this condition for a while now; with the right approach, there's no reason you can't continue to live a full, active life.
P: That's reassuring, thank you. You know, I worry about being a burden, especially on Marjorie. She's my rock, you see.
D: It's natural to feel that way, but from what I can tell, you've got a great support system in place. We'll work together to make sure both you and Marjorie feel supported throughout this process.

Atrial fibrillation is certainly a serious condition, but with the right management, there's every reason to believe you can continue to live the life you value—time with Marjorie, volunteering, and even those clarinet pieces on Sunday evenings.

D: I understand, Jaylen. Since you mentioned feeling this way in past visits, it’s likely related to your seasonal affective disorder. How have these symptoms been affecting your daily life recently?
P: It’s like my motivation, especially for my classes and even just staying up to date with my projects, sort of evaporates.

P: Well, I’ve been trying to stick to my usual routine, but I’ve definitely cut down on my outdoor shoots and even my morning walks. It’s just harder to get out of bed when it’s still dark, you know? I’ve seen some people using light therapy before, and I’m thinking maybe I should try it more consistently this year.
D: Light therapy can be quite effective. Are you currently using a light box, and if so, how often?
P: Yeah, I have one— bought it last year. I probably only used it sporadically, mostly when I remembered. I realize I should probably be more disciplined about it.
D: That sounds like a good step. Consistency really makes a difference. Have you noticed any other coping strategies that work for you, like adjusting your schedule or managing your sleep?
P: I’ve been trying to keep a regular sleep schedule, even if I don’t feel like getting out of bed early. I’ve also been listening to more upbeat music, trying to lift my mood that way. But sometimes, I just feel like I’m in this rut I can’t climb out of.
D: It’s understandable. Besides light therapy, we can discuss some behavioral strategies—like structured activities or short outdoor breaks during the day. Sometimes, even a quick walk in sunlight, if possible, helps.
P: Yeah, I’d like that. I think I just need a bit more guidance on how to keep myself going when everything feels gray. I’d also like to check in about maybe adjusting my routine or even some mild medication if it comes to that.
D: Absolutely, Jaylen. We can explore options. Sometimes, a combination of light therapy, behavioral adjustments, and, if necessary, antidepressant medication can help manage SAD effectively. Let’s also consider your mental health overall—are you experiencing any other mood changes or concerns?
P: Mostly just the seasonal stuff. I mean, I sometimes feel a little isolated, especially since I spend a lot of time alone. But I think that’s typical for me—being introverted, you know? Still, I’d like to be more active socially, even if it’s small local events.
D: That’s a positive approach. Social connection can be a great buffer against these seasonal lows. I can recommend some low-pressure activities or support groups that might suit you. Remember, you’re taking a good step by coming in today and talking about this.
P: Thanks, I appreciate that. It’s not always easy to talk about these things, but I know I need to face them. Hopefully, with some adjustments, I can still find the small moments of light— even if it’s just in my camera viewfinder.
D: That’s a great outlook. Let’s set up a plan for you—more consistent light therapy, some behavioral tips, and checking in regularly. And, of course, if your mood doesn’t improve or worsens, we can reassess and consider medication options.
P: Sounds good, doctor. Thanks for understanding. It’s comforting just knowing there are things I can do, and I’m not just stuck in this fog.
D: You’re welcome, Jaylen. Remember, you don’t have to navigate this alone. We’ll work together to get you feeling more like yourself this season.

D: Hi, Ethan. How have you been feeling lately? Any changes in your stomach aches?
P: Same, I guess. It still hurts a lot.
D: Okay, let's take a look at your chart. I see you've been trying some diet changes. Have you been sticking to the new plan?
P: Mostly. I mean, I try, but it's not like it makes a difference or anything.
D: That can be frustrating. Can you tell me more about what the pain feels like? Is it a sharp pain or more of a dull ache?
P: Dull, I guess. Like, my stomach's just sore all the time. Is this going to be like last time, where you just tell me to eat more fiber or something?
D: Actually, Ethan, today we're going to run some tests to see if there's anything else going on. We've ruled out some of the more obvious causes, so we want to dig a little deeper.
P: Tests? Like what kind of tests?
D: We might do an ultrasound or some other imaging to take a closer look at your digestive system. Don't worry, they're all relatively quick and painless.
P: Yeah, right. Because getting poked and prodded is always fun.
D: I know it might not be the most enjoyable experience, but we're just trying to figure out what's going on with your body, okay? We want to help you feel better.
P: Yeah, I know. Sorry. It's just... this has been going on for so long.
D: I understand. It can be really frustrating when we can't find an easy answer. But we're not giving up. We'll keep working together until we find a solution.
P: Alright, thanks, I guess. Just... can you explain what you're doing as you're doing it? I hate not knowing what's going on.
D: Absolutely, Ethan. I'll make sure to explain everything as we go. And if you have any questions or concerns, just let me know. We're a team here.

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Good morning, Doctor. I’m Marcus Jefferson. I’m a research analyst at the university, and my chronic tension headaches have been increasing in frequency and starting to interfere with my work. I’m hoping we can map triggers and land a solid plan to manage them.
D: Good morning, Marcus. I’m Dr. Chen. We’ll go over your symptoms, do a quick exam, and talk about triggers and treatment options. Any red flags you want to mention before we begin?
P: Not really. The pain is a steady bilateral pressure across the top of my head, sometimes behind the temples and at the base of the skull. It isn’t pulsating or stabbing. It can last a few hours, sometimes all afternoon when I’m deep in a policy brief.
D: How long has this been going on, and how often are you getting headaches now?
P: About a year, but the frequency has picked up recently. I can have several headache days per week, especially after long screen time or back-to-back meetings. Sleep has been inconsistent, which seems to amplify things.
D: On a 0–10 scale, how intense is the pain during the worst episodes?
P: Usually 5–7 during a flare, sometimes milder on calmer days, around 3.
D: Any associated symptoms? Nausea, vomiting, dizziness, or light sensitivity?
P: Light sensitivity can show up during a flare; nausea is rare. No aura, no neurological deficits.
D: What helps and what doesn’t?
P: Rest helps a bit. A warm neck wrap feels better. I take ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed, but I’m careful not to overuse them.
D: Any medical or family history of headaches?
P: I’m generally healthy. My mother has migraines, but mine feel more like tension-type headaches. No other issues.
D: How are your sleep, stress level, hydration, and caffeine?
P: Sleep is inconsistent. I’m under a lot of mental load at work. I drink about two to three cups of coffee daily; on nights with poor sleep I might drink more. Hydration is okay, but on busy days I slip. Stress from education policy work is constant.
D: Do you exercise or have posture concerns during the day?
P: I try to walk during the day and longer walks on weekends. I sit a lot with forward-head posture while reading lengthy briefs. I also decompress by playing jazz on an old upright piano; it helps reset my mind.
D: Anything else you want to add or any red flags you’ve noticed recently?
P: Not at the moment. I just want a plan that’s evidence-based and won’t require a blow-by-blow of every detail of my life.
D: That’s reasonable. Here’s what we’ll do: I’ll perform a quick physical exam to rule out anything urgent and then we’ll focus on triggers and management. We’ll discuss non-drug strategies, with medications only if needed.
P: That sounds good. I’d prefer a data-driven approach and starting with non-pharmacologic changes.
D: We’ll start with a headache diary for 2–4 weeks to identify patterns—time of day, activity, sleep, caffeine, hydration, posture. We’ll optimize sleep and hydration, manage caffeine, and introduce regular breaks to stretch and adjust workstation ergonomics. We’ll explore stress-management options, and consider physical therapy for neck/posture if needed. If headaches persist, we can discuss preventive meds.
P: I can do that. I’ll keep the diary and adjust my routine. If there’s a plan that aligns with my data-driven mindset, I’m on board.
D: We’ll plan a follow-up in about six weeks. If you develop new red flags—sudden severe pain, weakness, numbness, or vision changes—seek care sooner.
P: Understood. I’ll reach out if anything shifts. Thanks.
D: You’re welcome. See you in six weeks.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Hi, Dr.! We’re a little worried 'cause Malachi’s tummy has been grumbling and growling like a tiny, cranky dragon for a few weeks now. Sometimes, he’s okay, but other times, he just wrinkles up his nose and makes a sad face. 
D: Hello! Thanks for coming in today. Malachi, can you tell me what your tummy feels like when it hurts? Are you feeling any other way, like sleepy or more tired than usual?
P: Well, sometimes it feels like a little bubble, like when I blow bubbles in the bath but too much soap, and then it makes me want to scoot under my blanket. But other times, it’s just, like... a funny ache all over my belly. Not a big boom, just a tiny, hmm, yucky feeling. 
D: I see, that must be uncomfortable. And has the pain been happening more during certain times, maybe before going to daycare or when things at home change?
P: Oh, yes! That’s when it starts. Like today, I woke up and my tummy was grumbly. Mommy and Daddy told me it was ‘cause I was nervous 'bout the new story at school, but I don’t want to miss my turn reading my silly story about the dancing dinosaurs. 
D: That’s very sweet of you to want to share your stories. It sounds like these feelings can be tricky, especially with changes. Have you noticed if anything helps, like sitting down or cuddling with your favorite toy?
P: Yes! When I hug Mr. T-Rex or draw pictures of big happy animals, my tummy kinda calms down. And if I eat bananas or drink warm milk, it feels a little better, too. 
D: Those are excellent ways to soothe your tummy. Sometimes, these aches can happen when the brain and stomach are a little overwhelmed, especially with new routines or surprises. Do you ever feel worried or nervous about new things?
P: Mmm... I do, a little. When we go to new places or when Maa and Paa talk loud about big stuff, my cheeks turn all red, and I wanna hide behind Daddy’s leg. 
D: That’s normal! It’s okay to feel shy or a little nervous. We can think about some ways to help you feel more brave and comfortable, like taking deep breaths or bringing your favorite stories or toys.
P: I like that. Maybe I can bring my drawing pad to help my tummy feel better. Sometimes, I draw monsters or superheroes, and then I forget I have a tummy ache.
D: That’s a wonderful idea, Malachi. Drawing can be a great way to help your feelings. Let’s also talk about ways to keep your tummy happy and calm, and see if we might need to do a quick check-up just to be sure everything’s okay inside.
P: Okay, Dr.! I want my tummy to stay happy so I can play and tell my dinosaur stories without worries.
D: Absolutely, Malachi. We’ll work together to help you feel good again. You're doing a fantastic job sharing your feelings today.

gpt-5-mini,high,"P: Morning, doctor. Marcus Jefferson — thanks for squeezing me in. My tension headaches have gotten worse and they're starting to mess with my work and my piano practice. I want to figure out triggers and a realistic plan.
D: Good morning, Marcus. Sorry to hear that. Tell me what “worse” looks like — when did this change, where the pain is, what it feels like, and how often it happens.
P: They've been a thing for years, low-level and manageable. Over the last six months they've increased from once or twice a month to almost every other day — roughly a dozen to maybe eighteen days a month. It's a bilateral, pressing band, dull more than throbbing. Usually a 3–6, but under deadlines it can climb to a 7 and then my concentration disappears. No vomiting, no aura. Light and sound don't usually bother me.
D: Any new or unusual features — sudden severe pain, weakness, numbness, vision changes, slurred speech, balance problems, recent head trauma, fever?
P: No to all of those. Nothing sudden, nothing focal.
D: What seems to bring them on?
P: Long stretches at the computer — I'm a research analyst, so sitting with spreadsheets and manuscripts. Late nights practicing piano and doing crosswords sometimes trigger them. Coffee in the afternoon seems to nudge them. Also when I'm stewing over mentees or deadlines — stress and neck tension are obvious culprits.
D: What have you tried for relief?
P: Ibuprofen, 200–400 mg, about three or four times a week. Massage helps for a day or two. I take solitary walks to reset. I've read about biofeedback and CBT but haven't done a structured program.
D: Any other medical problems or medications? Allergies? Family history of headaches?
P: Nothing chronic, no regular meds, no allergies. My mother had migraines. I don't smoke, a couple of drinks weekly, coffee two cups in the morning and sometimes an afternoon cup. Sleep is patchy — I lie awake worrying sometimes.
D: Any jaw clenching? Dentist findings?
P: Dentist didn't see obvious tooth wear, but my jaw feels tight some mornings.
D: Okay. I'd like to do a quick neurologic and neck exam now.
P: Fine.
D: Vitals are normal. Neurologic exam normal — cranial nerves, coordination, strength and sensation intact. I do feel increased tightness in the suboccipital and upper trapezius muscles on both sides. No meningeal signs.
P: So that jibes with tension-type headaches?
D: Yes. Your description and the exam fit chronic tension-type headache — especially given the bilateral pressing quality, associated neck muscle tightness, and the frequency. No red flags on exam, so no immediate need for imaging.
P: Good. I like tidy diagnostics, but I also like nuance. What's the plan?
D: A stepped, evidence-based approach. First: start a headache diary for the next 6–8 weeks — date, start/stop times, pain score 0–10, probable triggers, and what you took. That gives us objective data. Second: minimize medication overuse — try to limit OTC pain meds to no more than two days per week while we implement other strategies. Third: nonpharmacologic therapies — targeted physical therapy for cervical mechanics, daily neck exercises and stretches, ergonomic adjustments at your workstation, regular short breaks, and progressive muscle relaxation or biofeedback. Fourth: behavioral therapy — CBT for pain management and CBT-I for your sleep can be very helpful.
P: Two days a week on meds? That's stricter than I was doing, but I see the logic.
D: Frequent analgesic use can perpetuate headaches. The diary will help us see if that's happening.
P: And if PT and CBT don't cut it?
D: If you still have significant headaches — especially if it stays at 15 or more days a month for three months — we can consider prophylactic medication. The most studied option for chronic tension-type headaches is low-dose amitriptyline at night. It often reduces frequency and improves sleep. Alternatives exist, but evidence is strongest for tricyclics and the nonpharmacologic measures we discussed.
P: I worry about anything that blunts my cognition. Do those meds make you foggy? I need to be sharp for analysis and for crosswords; my piano is sensitive to my timing.
D: At low doses — typically 10–25 mg at bedtime to start — many people sleep better and get fewer headaches without daytime sedation. Some experience dry mouth, constipation, or grogginess in the morning. We would start low, reassess in a few weeks, and stop if it affects your daytime function. If you want to avoid meds, we can try the conservative bundle first and hold meds as a back-up.
P: How long before I should expect to see improvement from PT or CBT?
D: You may notice some benefit in a few weeks, but meaningful reduction often takes 6–8 weeks of consistent work. CBT and biofeedback can give durable improvement if you engage with the program.
P: I prefer concrete actions. Can you give me the exercises and referrals? I don't want this to be all talk.
D: Absolutely. I'll send a PT referral focusing on cervical stabilization and myofascial release. I'll also give you a sheet with simple daily exercises — chin tucks, levator scapulae and upper trapezius stretches — and a short progressive muscle relaxation audio to use before bed. I'll refer you to a CBT program for stress and one for insomnia; I can include app-based options if you need time-efficient tools.
P: Biofeedback — is that worth the effort and often covered?
D: It has a good evidence base for tension headaches. Coverage varies by insurer and clinic. I can refer you to our pain clinic for an assessment; they offer biofeedback and can advise on coverage.
P: What about imaging? You said no need now, but I'm an analyst — tell me what would make you order an MRI.
D: Good question. We'd get imaging if you develop red flags: sudden severe or ""thunderclap"" headache, new neurological deficits, seizure, progressive changes, fevers, or signs suggesting raised intracranial pressure. With a normal neuro exam and the chronic pattern you describe, MRI is unlikely to change management.
P: If I have to start amitriptyline, how long would I try it?
D: Usually we trial at least two to three months at an effective dose to judge benefit. We'll titrate slowly. If it's helpful, you can stay on it and we reassess periodically; we always aim to minimize medications if nonpharmacologic strategies can control the headaches.
P: Insurance and time are real constraints for me. I like doing things myself when it's efficient. Any high-yield self-directed steps?
D: Yes — the diary; strict limits on analgesic use; ergonomic fixes ; nightly progressive muscle relaxation for 10–15 minutes; and short walking breaks during the workday. These are low-cost, high-yield.
P: One more: if I hit a 7 or 8 and need relief, what's your rescue advice?
D: Rescue with ibuprofen as you have been using is fine — keep it to the minimum. Add local heat or cold to the neck, gentle self-massage, a 10–15 minute walk, and a relaxation exercise. If pain is severe or persistent beyond a day despite rescue measures, call me.
P: Sounds reasonable. I'll start the diary today. I prefer to avoid starting meds unless necessary. Let's try the conservative path first and reassess in six weeks.
D: Agreed. I'll put the PT referral in, send the exercise sheet and relaxation audio link, and refer you to CBT resources, including time-efficient online options. I'll schedule a follow-up in six weeks. And if anything red-flaggy comes up — sudden severe headache, vision changes, weakness, fever — come in or go to the ER immediately.
P: Thank you. I appreciate a plan with concrete steps and data. I'll keep the diary and limit the ibuprofen.
D: Good. We'll review the diary at follow-up and adjust. See you in six weeks.

gpt-5,low,"P: Morning, Dr. Shah. I’m here for the follow-up on my thyroid labs—and to talk about this fatigue that keeps nipping at my heels.
D: Good morning, Karen. Thanks for coming in. How have you been feeling day-to-day?
P: Functional, mostly. But I’m dragging by mid-afternoon. The kind of tired that makes even chopping onions feel like a workout.
D: Understood. Are you still taking your levothyroxine?
P: Yes—88 micrograms. I take it first thing, before I feed the cats or check email. I wait about 45 minutes before breakfast.
D: Any coffee during that window?
P: Guilty. I’ve been sipping while I check overnight reports. It’s hard to wait.
D: Coffee can reduce absorption. Let’s try to keep coffee at least 60 minutes after taking the pill, or consider taking the medication at bedtime—three hours after your last meal.
P: Nighttime could work. Rick and I don’t eat late unless we’re on a road trip.
D: Perfect. Any missed doses?
P: Maybe one last month. I double-checked with the pharmacy app—pretty consistent.
D: Aside from fatigue, any changes in weight, temperature sensitivity, hair, or skin?
P: I’ve gained six pounds since spring. I’m colder than Rick at night. Hair seems okay. Skin’s a little dry, but Michigan in fall is basically a dehumidifier.
D: How’s your sleep?
P: Decent falling asleep, but I wake at 3 a.m. thinking about spreadsheets. I can usually drift back after a podcast.
D: Any snoring or gasping?
P: Rick says I snore lightly when I’m really wiped, but no gasping.
D: Mood or concentration shifts?
P: A bit foggy by afternoon. I’m still sharp, just slower. And a twinge of irritability when the rabbits raid my lettuce.
D: Understood. Diet and exercise lately?
P: Breakfast is usually yogurt with berries—or eggs if I’m testing a recipe. Lunch is leftovers. Dinner varies; I’ve been playing with roasted vegetables and fish. Weekends are my wild cards—new restaurants on road trips. Exercise: brisk walks four days a week, 30 minutes. Some light weights, though not religiously.
D: Any supplements or meds besides levothyroxine?
P: A multivitamin, vitamin D, and sometimes calcium at night. No biotin. Occasional ibuprofen for a stiff neck.
D: Good to know. Keep calcium at least four hours apart from your thyroid pill.
P: Got it. I’ll put a sticky note on the cabinet.
D: Menstrual history or menopausal symptoms?
P: Menopause last year. Occasional hot flashes, but manageable.
D: Great. Today we’ll repeat TSH and free T4. Given the fatigue and weight changes, I’d also like to check CBC, iron studies, B12, vitamin D, A1c, and a lipid panel. Any issues with that?
P: That’s fine. Data is my love language.
D: If your TSH is high, we’ll adjust your dose—likely to 100 micrograms. If it’s normal, we’ll look at other causes for fatigue and weight changes.
P: Makes sense. If the labs look okay and I’m still tired, what’s next?
D: We’d evaluate sleep quality, consider a sleep study if snoring worsens, fine-tune nutrition and resistance training, and review stress management. We can also discuss weight-management options—behavioral strategies first, and medications if appropriate.
P: I’m open to tightening up the plan. I can track meals for a couple of weeks. That usually reveals the weekend culprits.
D: Excellent. Aim for 90–120 minutes of moderate cardio weekly plus two days of resistance training. Protein target around 90–100 grams daily should help with satiety and muscle.
P: That’s doable. I’ll schedule strength sessions like a meeting, or I’ll skip them.
D: Good strategy. Any GI issues—constipation, bloating?
P: Some constipation. I’ve been pushing fiber and water. Prunes are back on the roster.
D: Helpful. A daily psyllium supplement can regulate things and support cholesterol.
P: Noted. I’ll add it to the lineup—away from the thyroid pill.
D: Correct. How’s work stress?
P: Quarter-end is always a circus, but I’m managing. I sometimes get stuck in perfection mode and lose steam.
D: Try setting “good enough” checkpoints. And short midday walks can lift energy.
P: I like that. A ten-minute loop between meetings.
D: Any new symptoms like chest pain, palpitations, swelling, or shortness of breath?
P: No, nothing like that.
D: Great. We’ll draw labs now. Switch levothyroxine to bedtime this week, keep coffee out of the morning window if you prefer mornings, separate calcium by four hours, and we’ll follow up when results return—usually 2–3 days.
P: Perfect. If we adjust the dose, will I feel it quickly?
D: Most notice changes within 1–2 weeks, full effect by 6–8 weeks. We’d recheck TSH in 6–8 weeks after any change.
P: Understood. I’ll keep a quick energy and sleep log so we have something concrete.
D: Love it. Anything else on your mind?
P: Just a hopeful request: if you can fix the fatigue before my next attempt at a soufflé, I’d appreciate it.
D: Challenge accepted. Let’s start with the labs and the timing change. We’ll fine-tune from there.
P: Sounds like a plan. Thank you, Dr. Shah.

D: Got it. Any fever or trouble breathing?
P: No fever, and I can breathe okay. It’s just sneezing and a runny nose.
D: Do you notice it more outside or inside?
P: Mostly outside. When I run around in the yard, pollen makes me sneeze and my eyes itch.
D: Do you have pets at home, or a lot of dust or mold?

D: Great. Your ears look clear, and your throat is fine. Your nose looks a little swollen—that can happen with allergies.
P: So it’s allergies? Can you fix it so I can go outside and not sneeze?
D: Yes. We’ll start with some simple steps: nasal saline spray to rinse your nose, and a non-drowsy antihistamine we can give you daily. If you need more help, we can add a nasal steroid spray.
P: Will the medicine make me sleepy?
D: Usually not, but we’ll watch for it. We’ll also talk about avoiding triggers and keeping windows closed on high pollen days.
P: I still want to go outside and play with my trucks, though.

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Doc, good to see you again. Dennis Callahan here—66, retired from a Nashville-area manufacturing firm. I spend my days in the garden, tinkering on a 1968 Chevy, and I still like a good debate at the diner.
D: Good to see you, Dennis. How has COPD been affecting you since the last visit?
P: Not great, to tell the truth. I’m winded more often, especially when I’m digging or carrying heavy pots. The garden used to be a couple of hours; now it’s a half-hour sprint.
D: I hear you. Let’s go through your meds and check your inhaler technique, and we’ll see what we can optimize.
P: I try to take the daily inhaler, but if I get pulled into a project in the yard, I forget. The rescue inhaler helps when I feel tight, though.
D: We’ll review technique and timing, and maybe simplify the regimen so you stay on track.
P: I want to keep my independence; I don’t want COPD to boss me around.
D: That’s a solid goal. We might add a long-acting bronchodilator or a combination inhaler if needed, and we’ll talk about pulmonary rehab and breathing strategies.
P: Sounds reasonable. I’d like to keep active—gardening, mowing a little, fixing the truck—without being punished by every breath.
D: We’ll also check your oxygen needs with activity. If your saturation drops too low, we may suggest home oxygen to support you during tasks.
P: Don’t want to be tied to machines, but I’ll use it if it helps me keep going.
D: Vaccinations matter for COPD too—flu every year and pneumonia prevention as indicated.
P: I quit smoking years ago, right? I don’t want to pretend that stuff didn’t happen, but I’m glad I stopped.
D: That’s excellent for your lungs. Your smoking history is a big factor in management.
P: Will I ever feel like my old self again?
D: We’ll aim to maximize function and minimize symptoms. With the right meds, breathing exercises, and rehab, you should be able to stay active.
P: And if something flares up—how soon should I call?
D: If you have chest pain, severe shortness of breath at rest, confusion, fever, or a change in the color or amount of sputum, seek care right away. For milder changes, call or schedule a visit.
P: Got it. When’s the next check-in?
D: Let’s plan 6–8 weeks, sooner if you worsen. We’ll monitor your spirometry and adjust as needed.
P: All right. I appreciate you taking the time to walk me through this, Doc.
D: You’re welcome, Dennis. We’ll take this one step at a time and keep you in the saddle.

gpt-4.1-mini,,"P: Good afternoon. I’ll be candid — these tension headaches have been increasingly persistent. I’ve noticed they intensify after prolonged periods of screen time, which unfortunately comprises most of my workday. It’s not simply a nagging pain anymore; it’s actively disruptive.
D: I see. Can you describe the nature of these headaches in more detail? Are they localized to a specific area, and how long do they typically last?
P: Primarily, the pain centers around my forehead and sometimes wraps around to the back of my neck. It’s this dull, unrelenting pressure rather than sharp or throbbing. Duration varies, but after a typical eight to ten hour research day, it can persist for several hours into the evening, sometimes punctuated by brief relief upon resting.
D: That sounds quite uncomfortable. Do you notice any particular triggers aside from screen time? For instance, stress levels, posture, caffeine intake, or sleep patterns?
P: Stress is an obvious candidate — my role demands meticulous attention to detail; even minor flaws in data or presentation can cascade into frustration. I’m conscious of maintaining decent posture, but admittedly, I don’t always succeed with ergonomics, especially when deep in problem-solving mode. Sleep is irregular some nights, but caffeine consumption is steady—a habit I guard carefully since I understand its impact. Still, the headaches persist despite these controls.
D: Understood. Have you tried any interventions, like over-the-counter medications, physical therapy, or relaxation techniques?
P: I have experimented with ibuprofen and occasional acetaminophen, yielding only modest relief. Physical therapy hasn’t been explored systematically; I tend to rely on self-directed stretching. As for relaxation, I listen to philosophy podcasts to unwind, but I’m not confident that passive listening qualifies as effective relaxation.
D: It would be beneficial to consider more structured approaches, like guided mindfulness or specific exercises targeting muscle tension. Also, evaluating ergonomic adjustments could alleviate some strain. Would you be open to incorporating physical therapy sessions or seeing a specialist if necessary?
P: Yes, I appreciate a methodical approach. If empirical evidence supports efficacy, I’m willing to engage with physical therapy. Specialist consultation could be warranted, but I’d prefer to start conservatively and track progress meticulously before escalating interventions.
D: That’s a sensible plan. Additionally, since your symptoms have worsened, I’d recommend a basic neurological evaluation to rule out other causes. Nothing alarming so far, but better to be thorough.
P: I concur — better to eliminate confounding variables than to speculate endlessly. Could we also discuss potential lifestyle modifications? I suspect my high cognitive load, compounded by these headaches, demands more deliberate breaks or perhaps scheduled neuro-recovery time.
D: Absolutely. Incorporating regular breaks, with stretching and visual relaxation exercises, can reduce strain. We can set reminders during your workday to prompt these. Also, mindfulness-based stress reduction practices have shown benefit for tension headaches.
P: That aligns with some literature I’ve reviewed on neuroplasticity and stress mitigation. I’ll commit to integrating those techniques. If symptoms persist, what pharmacologic options do we have without risking dependency or cognitive dulling?
D: There are preventive medications like certain low-dose antidepressants or muscle relaxants that can be considered. These aren’t habit-forming when used appropriately. But given your preference for a cautious approach, we’d reserve those if non-pharmacological methods prove insufficient.
P: Good to know. I’ll document the headache frequency and intensity, alongside any interventions I try. I value clarity in metrics — it helps me remain objective rather than conjecturing the problem’s scale.
D: Perfect. Let’s schedule a follow-up in four weeks to review your progress and adjust the plan as needed. Feel free to reach out sooner if symptoms worsen or new concerns arise.
P: Thank you. I appreciate the clarity and intellectual honesty here. It’s rare to find a clinical conversation that respects the inquisitive mindset rather than just glossing over symptoms. I look forward to tackling this with data on my side.

gpt-5-mini,low,"P: Hi! Hi! Hi! I found a mud monster outside! Want to see my truck? It’s yellow and squishy now. Heehee!
D: Hello Oliver — that mud monster sounds impressive. I’m Dr. Lee. Can you tell me about your cough? When does it happen?
P: My cough is like a frog. It wakes me up sometimes at night. Mom says it sounds like a honk. I cough after I play in the rain and when I chase bugs. Do bugs cough too?
D: Bugs don’t get colds like we do, but sometimes running and getting wet can make you cough more. Has the cough been happening after every cold this winter?
P: Yeah. After the colds I cough and cough so my mommy gives me soup. I still cough when I build big towers. Umm—my chest sometimes goes wheeze-wheeze like a kazoo.
D: Okay. Do you cough more at night or when you run? Any noisy breathing, fast breathing, or trouble talking because of breathlessness?
P: Night. Night night cough. And when I run with my dump truck, my chest goes wheezy and sometimes I stop and breathe like this *huffs and giggles*. I’m not sleepy when I cough. I like cartoons on Mommy’s lap then.
D: Thanks. Any fevers? Do you bring up green or yellow stuff when you cough? Any vomiting with coughing?
P: I had a fever once, like super hot. No green stuff, just lots of phlegm that’s sticky. Mommy says “eww.” I never barf.
D: Good to know. Any eczema, hay fever, or allergies? Anyone in your family with asthma?
P: My sister sneezes. Daddy says he had asthma when he was little. I have itchy arms sometimes from stickers.
D: That helps — family history matters. Can I listen to your chest? Take some big breaths for me and try to sit still like a statue.
P: I don’t like sitting still! But okay. Statue. Statue Oliver. *giggle* Truck is on my lap.
D: I hear some wheeze on breathing but your lungs are moving. It sounds like your cough after colds could be recurrent bronchitis, and with the wheeze and family history, it might be early asthma or reactive airways.
P: Asthma? Like a dragon? Do dragons cough too?
D: Sort of — asthma makes breathing harder sometimes, but we can treat it. We have medicine that helps your lungs open up so you can run and play without so much coughing.
P: Will I still be able to catch rain? I like catching rain.
D: Yes — we’ll try to help you so you can catch all the rain you want. I’m going to suggest a short trial of a quick-relief inhaler for when you wheeze or after you run, and an anti-inflammatory inhaler to help prevent the coughs after colds. Your parents will get a spacer so the medicine goes into your lungs easier.
P: A spacer? Is that like a tunnel for my truck?
D: Kind of like a little tunnel for the medicine. You breathe through it, and it’s easy and fun — we can practice here.
P: Yay! Can I press the button? Button!
D: You can, with help. I also want us to try a few other things: make sure no one smokes around you, use saline nose drops to clear boogies, and keep handwashing up so you get fewer colds. We’ll also make sure your flu vaccine is up to date.
P: No smoke please. Smoke makes my eyes sting and I can’t see the worms. I washed my hands after I dug for worms.
D: Excellent — worms are important. For testing: at his age breathing tests are tricky, so instead we’ll do a trial treatment and see how he responds. If he keeps coughing or has bad wheezing, we might refer to a pediatric pulmonologist or allergist and consider further tests.
P: Will there be needles? I don’t like needles. I scream like a goat.
D: We’ll avoid needles today. Vaccines can be a quick pinch later if needed, with a sticker afterward. No blood tests for now.
P: Stickers are the best. What if my cough gets super-duper worse?
D: If he has fast breathing, retractions , blue lips or face, high fever, or can’t drink, go to the ER right away. Otherwise, we’ll start the inhalers, check back in two to four weeks, and sooner if things change.
P: Okay. Two weeks is a long time. Do we get a prize if I’m good?
D: We can try for a sticker at each visit. Deal?
P: Deal! I’ll be the best statue. Hi, doctor — I can see a ladybug on your shirt!
D: I see it — nice spotting, Oliver. Let’s practice the inhaler with the spacer now and I’ll show your mommy how to use it.

qwen2.5:14b,,"P: Doc, I know you've heard this before, but my stomach’s still been acting up. It's like an annoying mosquito buzzing around, never really going away.
D: Ethan, we’ve talked about how important your mental health can be in affecting physical symptoms. Has anything changed recently that could be causing stress?
P: Stress? Are you serious? I'm twelve , not a superhero dealing with world-ending events.
D: Okay, humor aside. Do these pains affect your schoolwork or how you're feeling at home?
P: Sure thing, Doc. Every time there’s a pop quiz, my stomach just decides it wants a vacation day too.
D: And do things like sports or spending time outside help when the pain comes back?
P: Yeah, right—spending time ""outside""? As if Ohio in November actually exists for outdoor fun. I prefer being inside where reality filters through screens and books.
D: Ethan, your parents are here to support you. Maybe we can try a different approach to diet or consider some changes at school that might help ease the pain?
P: Changes at school? Like skipping science class entirely since Einstein’s theories probably triggered the first abdominal pain crisis ever documented?
D: I understand it's challenging sometimes. But think about how these simple adjustments could actually make you feel better and enjoy more of your activities.
P: Enjoy them... Okay, let the record show Ethan Granger is now officially skeptical about everything, including the idea of enjoying his life without constant stomach reminders. 
D: Ethan, I can see you’re strong-willed and clever—those are great traits. But remember, it’s okay to lean on others for help sometimes. Maybe there's something specific that’s really bugging you?
P: Hmph, if 'leaning' means listening to more explanations about my tummy, then no thanks—I’ve got comic books and video games.
D: Well, Ethan... Just know you’re not alone here. We’ll figure this out together, okay? How does a plan including some fun changes seem?
P: I do have one request... Maybe we could give those comic book heroes a chance to explain their world like grown-ups do theirs. Might actually make sense for once.
D: Alright, Ethan. Let's keep pushing forward and see what works best moving forward. You got this kid—I’m rooting for you all the way.

gpt-5,high,"P: Morning, Doc. My legs are staging a full-on mutiny, and my back’s joined the picket line.
D: Good morning, Sarah. Tell me more about what’s changed.
P: The nerve pain’s sharper and louder. Burning, zappy, pins-and-needles down both legs, worse on the left. Starts in my lower back, shoots through my bum, into the thighs and calves. Feels like someone swapped my nerves for live wires.
D: How bad is it on average, and during flares?
P: Baseline is a 6 out of 10 most days. Nights have been hitting 8 or 9. Sheets brushing my skin can set it off, which is just rude.
D: What makes it worse or better?
P: Cold weather, sitting more than 30 minutes, long car rides, and after I climb or ski. Stress doesn’t help. Heat packs, gentle stretching, and a cup of tea with a prayer give me a bit of peace. But it’s not lasting.
D: Any new weakness, numbness in the saddle area, bowel or bladder changes?
P: No saddle numbness. Bladder urgency’s the same as it’s been for years—annoying but predictable. No new accidents. Strength feels about baseline, but I’ve had two near-falls this month when the pain zapped me mid-step.
D: Any fevers, unexplained weight loss, or night sweats?
P: No. Just cranky and tired.
D: How’s sleep?
P: Choppy. I’m up at 2 a.m. pacing and bargaining with my legs. I average maybe four hours. I’m becoming nocturnal, which is inconvenient for Mass.
D: How is this impacting your activities?
P: I had to bail on two climbing sessions. Photography’s tough—can’t kneel or stand long, and the tingling kills my focus. Hosting movie night is still happening, but I’m horizontal on a heating pad like a cat on a radiator.
D: Walk me through your current medications and doses.
P: Gabapentin 600 mg morning, 600 mg midday, 900 mg at night. Baclofen 10 mg three times a day for spasms. Duloxetine 30 mg in the morning—started it a few months back. Naproxen if I’m desperate, though it doesn’t touch the burning. Lidocaine 5% patches when I remember. Melatonin for sleep sometimes.
D: Side effects?
P: Gabapentin turns my brain to cotton. Duloxetine gave me nausea the first week but that’s settled. Baclofen makes me a bit wobbly if I take it late. I don’t want to live in a fog; independence is kind of my thing.
D: Have you tried or used opioids or tramadol?
P: Tramadol after surgery ages ago—hated it. Felt seasick and weird. I’d rather not go that route unless we’re truly desperate.
D: Any cannabis or CBD?
P: I’ve tried a CBD balm; it’s mildly soothing but not a game-changer. I haven’t used THC—don’t want to be loopy.
D: Got it. Any past trials of amitriptyline or nortriptyline?
P: Amitriptyline years ago—dry mouth like the Sahara and I felt hungover. Never tried nortriptyline.
D: Understood. I’m going to do a quick exam. Let me know if anything hurts.
P: Fire away.
D: Your strength looks stable from prior visits, reflexes unchanged, sensation hypersensitive along the L4–S1 distribution, and increased tone in your calves. No red flag findings on exam, but with the worsening pattern we should investigate.
P: Investigate as in—what are we hunting for?
D: Sometimes after a spinal cord injury, people develop structural changes like a post-traumatic syrinx, or there can be new compression lower down. I’d like an MRI of your thoracic and lumbar spine with and without contrast to rule that out.
P: Sensible. How fast can we get that? I’m meant to be in Zion in three weeks, chasing sunsets.
D: I’ll mark it urgent. We should be able to schedule it within a week, and I’ll call you with results.
P: Brilliant. And in the meantime, I need something that doesn’t turn me into a sleepy panda.
D: Two medication options. One, we can switch from gabapentin to pregabalin, which is often better tolerated and can help more with the electric sensations. Two, we can increase duloxetine to a therapeutic dose of 60 mg if you can tolerate it.
P: Pregabalin—same family, less brain fog?
D: Often. We’d cross-taper: start pregabalin 75 mg at night for three days, then 75 mg twice daily, then adjust up as needed while gradually reducing the gabapentin. We’ll watch for dizziness and swelling.
P: I can try that. I’d like my head back.
D: And duloxetine—how’s your nausea now?
P: Gone. If 60 mg is the magic number, I’ll brace and try it.
D: Okay. We’ll move you to 60 mg daily in one week, after you’ve started pregabalin, to avoid stacking side effects on the same day.
P: Thank you for staggering it. I quite like not falling over.
D: For focal hot spots, use the lidocaine patches daily—up to three patches, 12 hours on, 12 off. There’s also an in-clinic 8% capsaicin patch we can schedule if the pain is localized.
P: The left calf and outer thigh are prime suspects. I’m game to try the spicy patch if needed.
D: Non-med options: a TENS unit can help some people; we can get you one. And I’d like to refer you to pain-focused physical therapy to work on pacing, desensitization, and core stabilization around your adaptive activities.
P: I’ll do the homework. I’m stubborn in all the best ways.
D: Pain psychology—CBT or ACT—can help with sleep and coping. We can integrate it with your faith practices if you’d like.
P: Yes, please. I pray plenty, but some new tools would be welcome. I’ll light a candle for you too.
D: I appreciate it. Down the road, if meds and therapy aren’t enough, we can discuss a spinal cord stimulator trial. It can reduce neuropathic leg pain for some people.
P: I’ve read about those. Does it play nicely with climbing and skiing?
D: After the initial healing period, many people return to active lifestyles. We’d go over precautions, but it’s a viable option if needed.
P: Noted. What about low-dose naltrexone? My advocacy group swears by it.
D: It’s off-label but can help some with neuropathic pain, with low risk of sedation. If the pregabalin and duloxetine combo isn’t enough, we can consider adding it.
P: Good to have in the back pocket.
D: Any concerns about cost or coverage with the medication changes?
P: Always. Duloxetine’s been fine with insurance. Pregabalin—I’m not sure.
D: We’ll send a prior auth and provide a discount card. If cost is an issue, we’ll find an alternative.
P: Cheers. I’d rather spend my money on lift tickets.
D: Regarding sleep, let’s first see how pain control improves. If needed, we can consider adding a small dose of trazodone at night later on.
P: Works for me. No new sedatives today, please.
D: Safety: while we’re adjusting meds, avoid driving long distances, climbing, or skiing until you know how you respond. Use your cane or chair for stability to prevent falls.
P: I’ll be sensible. Helmet stays on my head and off my pills.
D: Labs today: kidney and liver function, B12, thyroid, and A1c. It helps guide dosing and rule out contributors.
P: Poke away.
D: Any mood shifts—low mood, anxiety spikes—beyond the understandable frustration?
P: I’m anxious about the future, yes. Not hopeless, just… tired. My parish keeps me grounded. No thoughts of self-harm.
D: Thank you for sharing. We’ll support both the physical and emotional side.
P: Is there any reason I should stop volunteering at the church pantry this week?
D: No, but pace yourself and take breaks off your feet. Heat as needed.
P: Got it. If we find something scary on the MRI?
D: We’ll discuss it right away and involve neurosurgery if necessary. If it’s clean, we keep optimizing pain management.
P: Fair enough. And I really don’t want opioids.
D: Understood. That’s not our plan.
P: If the pregabalin makes me puffy as a sponge, do I just call?
D: Yes. Call or message me. We can adjust the dose or switch strategies.
P: Grand. Can we set a follow-up before my Zion trip?
D: I’ll see you in two weeks by video to check on the medication changes, and sooner if the MRI shows anything.
P: Perfect. If we could also print the PT orders, I’ll drop them off on my way to the rock gym.
D: I’ll hand them to you with the TENS prescription. I’ll also place the pain psychology referral.
P: Thank you, Doc. If you can also prescribe legs that behave, I’ll put you up for sainthood.
D: I’ll do my best on the earthly options. We’ll get a plan in motion today.
P: Deal. And I’ll bring you a photo from Zion—as long as my nerves stop being drama queens.
D: I’ll look forward to it. Let’s get you some relief.

D: Of course, happy to help. Hi there, Eli. How's it going? What seems to be going on when you're dancing?
P: It's like... I don't know. I get this weird feeling in my chest, and it's hard to breathe. And sometimes I cough a lot. But I don't want to stop dancing, 'cause I love it so much!
D: I understand. That doesn't sound like fun at all. Can you tell me more about when this started happening? Was it suddenly or did it come on gradually?
P: Um... I think it started a few weeks ago. I was practicing this really cool routine for my favorite song, and I just felt... stuck. Like, I couldn't breathe right.

gpt-5-nano,low,"P: Kathleen O'Malley, nice to see you again. How have you been since our last visit?
D: Good to see you, Kathleen. How have your blood pressure readings and symptoms been lately?
P: Mostly steady, though I’ve had a handful of lightheaded moments, especially when I stand quickly after cooking. You know my kitchen—lots of steam and wine glasses clinking, and I worry I might faint mid-chardonnay swirl.
D: I understand. Let’s start with the numbers and then we’ll talk about what those lightheaded spells could mean. Have you been measuring at home?
P: I have a cuff that’s been stubbornly cooperative in the mornings. I’m aiming for consistency—like a good risotto, you know, gradual and attentive.
D: Excellent analogy. What readings are you typically seeing in the morning, and do you notice any patterns with meals, caffeine, or stress?
P: Morning numbers hover in the high 120s to low 130s systolic, usually. Sometimes 135 if I’m anxious about the day. Post-meal, they dip or stay steady; I can’t quite tell. And stress—oh, the world doesn’t stop tugging at us, does it? But I’m careful about caffeine; I try to keep it modest.
D: That’s helpful. Any episodes of headaches, fainting, blurred vision, or chest tightness?
P: A few headaches, nothing unbearable. The lightheadedness feels like a quick tilt—like I’m momentarily off-balance, nothing scary, but it does nudge my nerves. I sit down, sip water, deep breath, and it passes.
D: Noted. Do you take any medications regularly, and have there been changes recently—new supplements, herbs, or alcohol?
P: I take a daily antihypertensive as prescribed a while back. I’ve been mindful about alcohol—mostly social, not heavy. I’ve started focusing on sleep, though lately it’s been fitful with the divorce aftermath and the city breathing loudly outside my window.
D: Sleep can definitely impact blood pressure. How many hours do you typically get, and do you have a bedtime routine?
P: About six to seven on good nights. I light a candle, play classical for a calm close to the day, and jot notes in a small journal—keeps the mind from spinning.
D: Given your age and history, we should review your current regimen and perhaps check for other contributing factors to lightheadedness—hydration, electrolyte balance, or orthostatic changes. Have you felt dizzy when you rise quickly from lying down or sitting?
P: Yes, sometimes. If I jump up after a nap, I pay a price. It’s like my body’s reboot process isn’t fully synchronized.
D: That can happen with dehydration or even subtle shifts in medications. I’d like to check your blood pressure and do a quick orthostatic test today. Then we’ll discuss whether a tweak to your regimen is warranted or if we should explore other causes.
P: I’m listening. I’d rather not scare the orchestra of symptoms into silence.
D: I appreciate that. We’ll approach it methodically. I also want to acknowledge your resilience—your life, your work, your advocacy. It’s important to balance safety with living fully.
P: Thank you. You always cue me to breathe. It helps, like a soft metronome in the back of my mind.
D: Let’s start with a fresh reading while you’re seated. Then I’ll help you interpret what we find and we’ll plan together.
P: And if we need to adjust, I’m ready to adapt—like changing a recipe to fit the guests at the table.
D: That’s the spirit. If we find stable readings, we may focus on lifestyle factors—hydration, gradual position changes, and continued stress management. If not, we’ll consider a medication adjustment and perhaps an evaluation for other causes.
P: I appreciate that. The idea of keeping control with grace—well, that sounds almost like composing a piece rather than fighting a storm.
D: Exactly. Your voice, your posture, your routine—these matter. Now, I’ll take your BP and note orthostatic changes. Then we’ll decide the next steps together.
P: Ready when you are. And doctor, if the numbers sing a different tune, I trust your score will guide us with the same care I bring to a well-seasoned sauce.

gpt-5,high,"P: Morning, Doctor. I’m here because my knees have been more stubborn than usual—stiff, achy, and now it’s cutting into my cooking and my walks.
D: Good morning, Ellen. Thanks for coming in. Let’s get specific—when did the worsening start, and what does a typical day of knee pain look like?
P: About three months, steadily creeping. Mornings are the worst—stiff for 20–30 minutes. By late afternoon, if I’ve been standing at the stove, it’s a deep, grinding ache. Friday dinner prep really lights it up.
D: One knee or both? Any swelling, locking, giving way, redness, or fever?
P: Both, but the right is the diva. Mild swelling on long days. No locking. Twice it felt like it might buckle going down stairs. No redness, no fever.
D: On a 0–10 scale, what’s the average pain, and what’s the peak?
P: Average 4–5. Peak 7 on Fridays. Stairs and kneeling are a hard no.
D: What are you using for relief right now—meds, braces, ice, anything else?
P: Diclofenac gel three times a day. Naproxen 220 mg if I need it, maybe twice a week. Heat before I start cooking, ice after. I have basic knee sleeves; they’re… fine. I also use an anti-fatigue mat and sit for chopping, but I’m slower.
D: Any stomach issues with naproxen? Ulcers? Kidney problems? Other meds or supplements?
P: Mild reflux—I use famotidine. No ulcers. No kidney problems that I know of. No blood thinners. Supplements: turmeric and omega-3.
D: Got it. How’s this affecting life beyond the kitchen—walks, church, sleep, work?
P: I’ve cut my arboretum loop in half. I sit through most of Mass instead of kneeling. Sleep is choppy if I push too hard. At work I’m seated mostly, but stairs at the office sting.
D: Any prior imaging or physical therapy?
P: X-rays last year showed moderate OA. PT last spring—quad and hip work. I kept the home set going until recently when the pain started talking back.
D: Okay. I’ll examine you briefly. Let me know where it’s tender.
P: Sure.
D: I’m feeling some crepitus and mild swelling on the right, range of motion a bit limited, ligaments feel stable. This fits with osteoarthritis flaring. We can update your X-rays to see progression.
P: That works. I’m hoping for a concrete plan. Steps, timelines. I do well with structure.
D: Absolutely. First, non-medication: restart structured PT—two times a week for 6–8 weeks, focusing on quads, hips, and glutes, plus gait and stair mechanics. Add pool or cycling on non-PT days if you can.
P: I can fit that in. Mornings work best.
D: Medications: keep diclofenac gel on a schedule—four times daily if possible. For flares or activity-heavy days, we can try a short, regular course of an NSAID like naproxen with food for 1–2 weeks, then back to as-needed. We’ll monitor your stomach; if needed we can add a protective medication.
P: I’d like guardrails. What’s the risk profile versus benefit?
D: Topical diclofenac is low risk and helps many people. Oral NSAIDs can reduce pain meaningfully but carry risks—stomach irritation or bleeding, kidney strain, and blood pressure effects if used long term. We’ll use the lowest effective dose for the shortest time and check labs if we make it regular.
P: Understood. What about injections? A friend swears by a “gel shot.”
D: Two main options: corticosteroid and hyaluronic acid. Steroid injections can give relief in days and last weeks to a few months. We generally limit to three or four per year per knee. Hyaluronic acid can help some people for several months, but results vary and insurance coverage can be spotty.
P: If you were me?
D: Given your schedule and pain pattern, a steroid injection in the right knee could help you get through PT and your Friday marathons, then reassess. We could consider hyaluronic acid later if needed.
P: Side effects on the steroid?
D: Temporary soreness, rare infection, and a transient sugar spike if diabetic. Occasional flushing. Most people do well. I’d suggest light activity for 24–48 hours after.
P: Okay. I might do the right knee next week so I don’t waste a Friday dinner experiment. Can we plan that?
D: Yes. We’ll order the medication and book you early next week. Today we’ll set PT and the X-ray.
P: Bracing—do I need something more than a sleeve?
D: If your X-ray shows one compartment is more affected, an unloader brace can help, especially with walking or cooking. We’ll try one after we see the images. For now, a quality sleeve and supportive shoes are fine.
P: Duloxetine—worth considering?
D: It can help chronic knee OA pain. Start 30 mg daily, may increase to 60 mg. Side effects can include nausea, dry mouth, sleep changes, and rarely blood pressure or mood effects. It’s an option if PT, topical, and occasional NSAIDs aren’t enough.
P: I’d like to hold that in reserve for now.
D: That’s reasonable.
P: Kitchen mechanics—give me practical fixes. I can engineer my station.
D: Rotate tasks every 20–30 minutes; alternate standing and sitting. Use two anti-fatigue mats, one by the stove and one by the sink. Keep heavy pots at waist height. Consider a rolling cart. Use lighter pans. Ice the knees 10–15 minutes after long sessions. For kneading, split the batch or use a stand mixer for the heavy part and finish by hand.
P: I can map that into my prep flow. What about my walks?
D: Shorter, more frequent loops instead of one long one. Flat paths. Try walking poles for offloading. If pain rises above a 6/10, turn back or switch to the pool that day.
P: Metrics—I keep a log. What should I track?
D: Daily pain score, minutes of morning stiffness, step count or walking time, number of stairs tolerated, sleep quality, and how long you can stand at the counter before needing a break. A weekly five-times sit-to-stand time is useful too.
P: Perfect. I’ll chart it.
D: Regarding imaging, we’ll do weight-bearing X-rays. MRI isn’t usually needed unless we suspect something beyond OA, like a meniscal tear with locking.
P: Good. Last thing—timeline on knee replacement. I’m not rushing, but I like to know the trigger point.
D: When pain and function don’t respond to conservative care, it limits your daily activities, and X-rays show advanced joint loss, that’s when we refer. Many people aim for the point where everyday life—not just high-demand days—is consistently impacted.
P: That gives me a north star.
D: Any history of diabetes, high blood pressure, or heart disease?
P: No diabetes, blood pressure’s generally fine, no heart disease.
D: Great. Then the plan: update X-rays this week, start PT next week, schedule a right-knee steroid injection early next week, use diclofenac gel four times daily, naproxen with food for 1–2 weeks during the ramp-up if needed, and we’ll reassess in 6–8 weeks.
P: Clear and doable. Do you want labs before regular NSAIDs?
D: If we end up using them daily beyond a couple weeks, yes—we’ll check kidney function and monitor blood pressure.
P: Noted. And I’ll keep Friday dinners, just smarter.
D: Exactly. If you have a pain spike, increased swelling, redness, or fever, call me. Otherwise we’ll meet after PT to review progress and the X-rays.
P: Thank you. Direct, actionable—my favorite combo.
D: My pleasure, Ellen. We’ll get this to a better place.

qwen2.5:14b,,"P: Doctor, thank you so much for seeing me today. It’s been another few weeks since my last checkup, and I confess, I’ve been a bit anxious about how the numbers might be looking.
D: Kathleen, hello! How are you? Let's take a seat first. You look a little pale—are you feeling alright?
P: Oh, it’s nothing serious. Just a bit overwhelmed with work lately and some episodes of dizziness that have left me worrying more than anything else.
D: I see. We’ll run a quick check on your blood pressure right away. Do these instances occur when you’re standing up suddenly or at other times?
P: Mostly in the morning, actually. Just as I’m starting my day and preparing for my yoga routine. It’s almost like a wave hits me out of nowhere.
D: Interesting. Yoga is good for stress levels generally, but let's make sure your balance isn’t being affected by something else that needs our attention.
P: Absolutely. I mean, the last thing I need is to become one of those seniors who falls in their own home! It’s a frightening thought.
D: We don’t have any evidence suggesting anything serious right now—let’s stick with monitoring your BP and adjusting your medication as necessary. Can you tell me about when these episodes started? Have they been occurring frequently?
P: Yes, it seems to have ramped up over the last few months, particularly after my divorce proceedings were finalized.
D: I see—and how has that affected your overall mood and day-to-day activities?
P: Oh, God, with those papers flying around, sometimes I’d rather be anywhere but home. But honestly, cooking still makes me feel grounded—I just started a new menu that incorporates organic ingredients for summer freshness.
D: Great to hear that you’re staying busy positively. And any change in diet or routine can impact blood pressure levels. How about exercise?
P: Yoga twice weekly, and I’ve been considering pilates to complement my regimen but haven’t fully committed yet.
D: That’s good. We might want to tailor your exercises a bit more carefully moving forward. You know, keeping an eye on any sudden dizziness could also mean something else like low blood sugar or dehydration as causes too.
P: Yes, you’re absolutely right—I sometimes forget how hydration can affect things overall. But honestly, I’m still processing all these health concerns with aging...
D: It’s normal to feel that way! Aging gracefully means staying proactive—like keeping up your doctor visits and being mindful of how lifestyle impacts our physical state.
P: That makes sense. So, what do we adjust today? Any changes in medication or lifestyle suggestions?
D: We’ll tweak the dosage of your current antihypertensive for now, but I’d encourage you to keep a diary logging instances of dizziness and noting how and when they happen.
P: Alright, that does sound helpful. Humming tunes always gets me through tough times, so here’s hoping this one hums nicely into my seventies!
D: That’s the spirit! Stay in touch if anything worsens or changes significantly.
P: Absolutely—thanks for your diligence, Doctor. See you soon, I’ll be humming all the way home!

Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct,,"P: Hey doc, on time as always. Appreciate that.
D: Ah, Monica, good morning! How have you been feeling since our last visit?
P: Honestly, pretty crummy. The muscle weakness is getting worse, and fatigue's kicking my butt. I'm talking needing three naps a day. It's like my body's a ticking time bomb – no idea what's gonna give out next.
D: Sorry to hear that. Let's review your current treatment plan and see if there's anything we can adjust. How's your medication been working?
P: It's...fine, I guess. I'm taking the shots, but like I said, my symptoms are still getting worse. And those side effects? Ugh. Brain fog, joint pain...feels like I'm trading one problem for another.
D: I understand your concerns. We may need to consider a different medication or adjust the dosage. Can you walk me through your typical day? What's a good day look like for you, and what's a bad day?
P: Okay...well, on a good day, I wake up, do some stretching, take my meds, and manage to get out for a photo walk or some errands without needing a nap. I can actually get some real work done – volunteering, managing my finances...you know, adulting. A bad day? Forget it. I'm stuck in bed, too weak to even make myself a sandwich.
D: That must be really tough for you. Have you noticed any triggers that make your symptoms worse?
P: Triggers? You mean beyond just existing? Okay, okay...if I'm being honest, stress doesn't help. Worrying about my finances, my visa, my future...it all piles up. And don't even get me started on these ridiculous insurance bills.
D: I can imagine. Let's talk about some stress management techniques, and I'll also see what we can do to help with those insurance costs. What do you think about trying some physical therapy to help with the weakness?
P: Physical therapy? I don't know...I've tried it before, and it was just so...unpredictable. Some days I could do everything, and others...well, you know. But I guess it's worth trying again if it might help.
D: Okay, I'll give you a referral. I also want to schedule an MRI to check for any new lesions. Are you okay with that?
P: Yeah, sure. Whatever it takes to get this under control. Just...please, can we try to find something that works? I'm tired of being tired.
D: Monica, I'm committed to finding the right treatment plan for you. We'll work together to get your symptoms under control. And in the meantime, keep taking care of yourself, okay?
P: Alright, alright...thanks, doc. Just...thanks.

gpt-4.1,,"P: So, uh, I’m back. Third time’s the charm, right? Maybe this time my stomach will actually cooperate.
D: Hi Ethan. It’s good to see you again. I hear those stomach aches are still causing trouble. Can you tell me how you’ve been feeling lately?
P: Honestly? Pretty much the same. My mom’s been on this big “no more spicy food, no more soda” thing, but—surprise—it didn’t magically cure me. Go figure.
D: I see. Are the pains happening at any particular time, like after meals or when you go to school?
P: They just hit whenever, kind of like pop quizzes. But worse, ’cause you can’t just guess your way out of it. Sometimes it’s after I eat, sometimes it’s just randomly. Makes playing Mario Kart a real pain.
D: Can you show me exactly where it hurts on your stomach?
P: It’s usually here. But sometimes it moves around. Like it’s playing hide and seek, which would be way more fun if I wasn’t the seeker every time.
D: I know you’ve made some diet changes already. Have you noticed anything—anything at all—that seems to make it better or worse?
P: Not really? I’ve tried eating super plain stuff—white bread, applesauce, and all that bland cafeteria food nonsense. Still hurts. Mom made me keep a food diary. Kinda felt like I was on a detective show, but without the cool gadgets. And no big clues.
D: It sounds frustrating. Is it ever bad enough to stop you from doing things you like?
P: Sometimes. Last week I had to skip skateboarding. Didn’t want to puke on my board. And I almost missed my science fair thing, but I made it. Stomach pain or not, I wasn’t gonna miss my volcano erupting.
D: That’s dedication! How’s your sleep? Any trouble falling or staying asleep?
P: Meh. Sometimes I wake up ’cause it hurts, but mostly I just can’t get comfortable. Or my little sister talks in her sleep about unicorns. Not helpful, obviously.
D: And about school—any stress lately, anything on your mind that you think might be connected?
P: Homework’s annoying, but it’s not like I’m the only one who thinks that. I mean, teachers just love saying “it’s for your own good” but…I’m not buying that. Things are normal, I guess, just…normal with bonus stomach pain.
D: I appreciate you telling me all this. Do you have any ideas about what you think is going on? Or what you wish adults would understand about how you feel?
P: Honestly, I think everyone’s making this a bigger deal than it is. Maybe it’s just…me. Growing pains or whatever. Or aliens. At least aliens would be interesting. Mostly, I just wish people would stop acting like I’m making it up or it’s “all in my head” or something. I just want answers. Not “let’s wait and see” stuff.
D: That makes sense. Sometimes, stomach pain like this can be tricky, especially when all the usual tests are normal. We call it functional abdominal pain. It’s real, not “in your head.” But the causes can be a mix of things: stress, gut sensitivity, maybe your body’s just extra responsive right now.
P: Great. So I’m basically a science experiment with no clear instructions. Classic.
D: I know this is tough, but you’re not alone. We’ll keep trying to help you manage it. If you’re okay with it, we can look into some ways—like relaxation techniques, maybe working with someone who helps kids with pain. Or if you’re super against that, we can talk about other options.
P: If “relaxation” means less homework and more video games, I’m in. Or maybe just a magic button to turn the pain off. But…whatever, I’ll try your ideas.
D: Thanks, Ethan. That’s a deal. I’ll also share some info with your parents about pain management. Any other questions for me right now?
P: Are you gonna poke me again today or send me for even more tests? ’Cause if you are, just give me a heads up so I can brace myself. Or run.
D: No poking today—I promise. We’ll just check your weight and chat a bit more. Sound okay?
P: As long as there’s no surprise shots, I’ll survive. Probably.

gpt-5-mini,medium,"P: Hello, Doctor—Kathleen O’Malley. I brought you my best manners and a hum I picked up from my mother; sorry if it’s catching.
D: Good morning, Kathleen. Nice to meet you. I see you’re here for a blood pressure follow-up and some lightheadedness—tell me what’s been happening.
P: Yes. I’ve had a few episodes over the last month—sudden wooziness when I stand up from the stove or after sitting at a concert. Once I felt like I might very nearly take a bow I hadn’t rehearsed for. No full fainting, thank goodness, but it’s unnerving when you’re sixty and living on your own.
D: Understandable. How often does this happen, and how long does it last?
P: Maybe two or three times in the past four weeks. It lasts a minute or two—kind of a wash of lightheadedness, a little clammy. I sit down, hum a tune, and it passes.
D: Any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, jaw pain, or visual changes during these episodes?
P: No chest pain. Occasionally my heart flutters a bit—like after too much coffee or a glass of wine—nothing dramatic. Vision blurs a little for a moment sometimes.
D: Do you take any medications? Prescription, over-the-counter, supplements?
P: I take lisinopril 20 mg every morning and hydrochlorothiazide 25 mg in the morning. I also take a daily multivitamin and, if my knees protest, an occasional ibuprofen. And yes, I confess to a glass or two of red wine most nights while I’m cooking.
D: Any recent changes to those medications or new ones started?
P: No changes. I’ve been on the lisinopril for a couple of years and the HCTZ about a year.
D: Any dizziness when you get up in the morning, or mostly later in the day?
P: Mostly later. Often when I stand up after plating a meal—or after I’ve stood in the kitchen for a while and then move. I attributed it to fussing over a soufflé, frankly.
D: Any recent weight loss, diarrhea, vomiting, or decreased fluid intake?
P: No GI problems. I might be drinking a touch less water—too busy—and the wine might not help.
D: Any falls or near-falls?
P: No falls. A couple of shaky moments, but I sat down and finished dinner. Priorities.
D: Have you been checking your blood pressure at home? If so, what readings?
P: I have a cuff—brought it with me. I’ve been getting numbers in the 120s over 70s most days at home. Once it was 100 over something and I felt off.
D: Alright. I’d like to take your blood pressure here and do orthostatic measurements—lying, sitting, and standing—if that’s okay.
P: Please do. I’ll try not to hum while you take it.
D: Sitting BP 126/76, pulse 72. Now standing at one minute: BP 102/64, pulse 78.
P: That’s a drop.
D: Yes—your systolic dropped about 24 mmHg on standing, which can explain the lightheadedness. That’s orthostatic hypotension. We’ll troubleshoot causes: medications, volume status, autonomic function.
P: So my pills are to blame?
D: They could be contributing. The hydrochlorothiazide can reduce blood volume and increase orthostatic symptoms, particularly if you’re a bit dehydrated or have lower baseline pressure. Lisinopril less commonly causes dramatic drops on standing, but any antihypertensive can play a role. Ibuprofen can affect kidney function and blood pressure too, so I’d avoid it when possible.
P: Huh. I hate the thought of giving up my HCTZ if it keeps my numbers tidy. I like tidy numbers.
D: I understand—your blood pressure is well controlled. But the priority now is safety and preventing fainting or falls. Options: adjust or hold the diuretic, check your electrolytes and kidney function, change timing of medication to morning, increase fluids and salt modestly, compression stockings, and review other medications. I’d also like an ECG and ambulatory monitoring if needed.
P: I like the clinical precision of your plan. What would you do first?
D: First step: stop the HCTZ for now and see if symptoms improve—unless you prefer an alternative. We’ll check BMP to assess kidney function and electrolytes today. I’ll order an ECG. Also, I want you to monitor your blood pressure at home: take readings lying after five minutes, then sitting, then standing at one and three minutes, twice daily, and bring the log.
P: Stop the diuretic cold turkey? Will that cause rebound?
D: It’s usually safe to stop a thiazide diuretic; we’ll keep the lisinopril. If your blood pressure rises, we’ll consider an alternative med less likely to cause orthostasis, like a low-dose ACE alone or a calcium channel blocker with careful monitoring. We’ll tailor it to how you do and the lab results.
P: Good. And the wine?
D: Limit alcohol for now—alcohol can worsen orthostatic symptoms and interact with blood pressure control. Try to keep to an occasional glass, not nightly, until we know more.
P: That’s a bleak sentence, but fair. I’d rather not faint in Symphony Hall.
D: Noted. Also, increase fluid intake—aim for regular sips in the day—and consider having a salty snack in the morning if you don’t have high salt sensitivities. Avoid standing quickly; when rising, pause at the edge of the seat, shift your weight, and stand slowly. Compression stockings can help if symptoms persist.
P: Compression stockings—how chic. I’ll look for ones that match my kitchen aesthetic.
D: There are plenty in tasteful colors. I’ll write a prescription and recommendations. We also need labs: BMP and a thyroid-stimulating hormone test, and I’ll order an ECG now.
P: Any thought to heart rhythm issues? I do get the occasional flutter—probably from excitement about a good review at the theatre.
D: If your ECG shows abnormalities or if you have palpitations with dizziness, we may consider ambulatory rhythm monitoring. For now, record any palpitations, their timing, and any associated symptoms.
P: Will you also check anxiety—because when my heart flutters I think of every headline and my ex’s warnings, and it doesn’t help.
D: Yes—we’ll screen you for anxiety and depression. You’ve had a major life change—recent divorce—living alone. That can worsen symptoms and perception of them. Counseling or a support group might be helpful; I can provide referrals.
P: I’d like that. I volunteer on an arts board, so I stay busy, but some nights are quieter than I’d prefer.
D: Social engagement is protective; keep doing what you love. Also maintain regular exercise—light resistance and walking help blood pressure and orthostatic tolerance. Avoid prolonged standing in hot kitchens without sipping fluids.
P: Noted. I’ll eat, hum, sip, and not faint. Anything else you want from me today?
D: Please bring your home blood pressure cuff and a log of readings to the lab or next visit. I’ll stop the HCTZ today, order the BMP and TSH, get an ECG, and give you a note for compression stockings. If you have new syncope, chest pain, or worsening palpitations, go to urgent care or the ER.
P: Understood. Thank you, doctor. I appreciate being taken seriously—sometimes I feel like everyone assumes I’m just dramatic about aging.
D: You’re not dramatic—this is a real safety issue and we’ll manage it. Let’s touch base after your labs and ECG; I’ll call you with results and next steps.
P: That sounds excellent. I’ll bring a log, my cuff, and perhaps a lemon tart when we know it’s safe.

gpt-4.1-mini,,"P: Good morning, Doctor. I appreciate you seeing me on such short notice. I’ve been feeling a bit off lately—those irregular heartbeats seem to have grown more persistent, and I tire more quickly than before.
D: Good morning, Walter. I’m glad you came in. Can you tell me a bit more about these palpitations? When did you first notice the increase?
P: It started about ten days ago, I’d say. I was sitting with my coffee, reading the Journal, when suddenly my chest felt like it was skipping beats. It’s a strange sensation, not quite painful, but enough to make me uneasy. Then the fatigue set in, like I was running on empty even though I’d had a good night’s sleep.
D: That does sound concerning, especially with your history of atrial fibrillation. Have you noticed any other symptoms? Shortness of breath? Dizziness?
P: Occasionally a bit of lightheadedness when I stand up too fast, but no fainting or chest pain. My breathing feels a little shallow, though—less air seems to fill my lungs than before.
D: Thanks for sharing that. How have you been managing your medications? Are you taking everything as prescribed?
P: Yes, I keep a strict regimen. Warfarin and metoprolol, just as we discussed previously. I’ve been very careful not to miss a dose, though sometimes I worry my blood pressure’s creeping up anyway.
D: Good to hear you’re consistent. Have you checked your blood pressure and pulse at home recently?
P: I have. The pressure tends to hover around 140 over 85, maybe slightly higher on bad days. Pulse feels irregular, more ragged than usual. I record it in my journal, alongside my coffee notes—helps me stay grounded.
D: That discipline is excellent, Walter. Given your symptoms and those readings, it might be time to review your medications and possibly adjust doses. We also want to reduce your risk of stroke and other complications.
P: I was afraid of that. I worry about what the future holds, especially with Marjorie relying on me. I want to keep doing our garden work, keep the music alive in me. Those Sunday evenings with the clarinet—they’re a balm I can’t imagine losing.
D: Your routine and passions are important not just emotionally but for your overall health. We’ll try to find a balance between controlling the arrhythmia and maintaining your quality of life. Have you been experiencing stressful situations lately?
P: Oh, yes. The news worries me—politics, the economy—it all feels so unstable. Sometimes, I wrestle with anxiety in the quiet moments, even though I try to carry my faith as a steady anchor. Marjorie keeps me grounded, but I suspect my nerves contribute to the palpitations.
D: That’s insightful, Walter. Anxiety can indeed exacerbate heart rhythm issues. We might consider some particular interventions for the anxiety alongside your cardiac care, perhaps counseling or medication—whatever you feel comfortable with.
P: I appreciate your thoroughness. I admit, I’m hesitant about leaning on others for my own worries, but maybe it’s time to reconsider. This self-criticism I harbor hasn’t been doing me any favors.
D: It’s a common feeling, but you don’t have to face this alone. We’ll build a plan together. For now, I want to run an EKG and some blood tests to see where we stand with your atrial fibrillation and anticoagulation levels.
P: Very well. I’m grateful for your care. It’s reassuring to talk openly about these things, beyond the numbers and doses.
D: That’s what I’m here for, Walter. Let’s take this one step at a time, so you can keep enjoying your mornings, your garden, and those clarinet melodies.
P: Thank you, Doctor. With your help, I hope to keep the music playing, in my heart and in the room.

gpt-5-mini,high,"P: Morning. I'm Marcus Jefferson.
D: Morning, Marcus. What brings you in today?
P: My tension headaches. They've been creeping up — used to be once or twice a month, now it's almost every week, sometimes every day. It's starting to mess with my concentration at work.
D: How long has this escalation been happening?
P: Probably over the last four to six months. Slow incline, then more abrupt the last two months.
D: Describe the headache — where it is, what it feels like, how long it lasts.
P: It's a bilateral pressure, like a band across my forehead and sometimes into the base of my skull. Dull, squeezing. Usually a four to six out of ten, sometimes seven. They build over a few hours, not sudden, and last from a couple hours to most of the day if I don't do anything.
D: Any nausea, vomiting, visual changes, numbness, weakness, difficulty speaking, or fainting?
P: No nausea or vomiting. No numbness or weakness. Light sensitivity if it ramps up, but not classic migraine stuff.
D: Any recent head trauma, fever, or unexplained weight loss?
P: No.
D: What do you do for them now?
P: I take ibuprofen when it gets bad. Maybe three to four times a week lately. Sometimes acetaminophen. I try a hot pad on my neck. That helps a bit.
D: Do you have any prescriptions now — for pain, blood pressure, antidepressants, anything?
P: No regular meds. No prescriptions for these.
D: How's your sleep?
P: Not great. I get six-ish hours most nights; worries about work and a study I'm reviewing sometimes keep my mind spinning. I walk at night to clear it, but sleep is inconsistent.
D: Caffeine and alcohol?
P: Coffee — two mugs in the morning, sometimes a small cup in the afternoon if the day's rough. Alcohol infrequently — a beer or two on weekends.
D: Any jaw pain or teeth grinding?
P: Hmm. My dentist mentioned mild wear last year; I catch myself clenching when I'm deep into a paper or a crossword.
D: Occupation?
P: Research analyst at the university. Lots of reading, data, and screens. I play piano in the evenings, which helps — unless my neck is angry.
D: Any history of depression or anxiety?
P: I worry. Not diagnosed depression. I tend to ruminate about the inequities we study. It keeps me alert — maybe too alert.
D: Any family history of headaches or neurologic disease?
P: My mother had migraines, but her pattern was different — throbbing and nausea.
D: Any red flags — sudden worst headache of your life, progressive morning vomiting, seizure, fever, recent cancer or immunosuppression?
P: None of those.
D: Okay. I want to do a quick neurologic exam — follow my finger with your eyes, look up and down, check strength and reflexes. Can you sit up for that?
P: Sure.
D: Exam's normal — cranial nerves, motor, sensation, coordination all intact. No focal deficits.
P: Good to hear. So tension-type?
D: Most consistent with chronic tension-type headache, given bilateral band-like pressure, absence of migraine features, and increased frequency. No signs to suggest secondary causes, so imaging isn't indicated right now.
P: That tracks. I'm concerned ibuprofen use — don't want to develop rebound or something.
D: Valid concern. For simple analgesics like ibuprofen or acetaminophen, overuse headache risk increases when used frequently — I generally advise keeping simple pain meds to no more than two days per week. For chronic daily symptoms we look at preventive options.
P: Two days a week. Noted. I'm a bit reluctant to start chronic medication unless the evidence is solid. What's the prophylaxis data?
D: For chronic tension-type headaches, there is good evidence that low-dose tricyclic antidepressants — amitriptyline — reduce frequency and intensity. Behavioral therapies like CBT and biofeedback also have solid evidence and similar benefit sizes in studies. Physical therapy for neck and shoulder tension helps as well.
P: Amitriptyline — odd name. Mechanism?
D: At low doses it modulates serotonin and norepinephrine pathways involved in pain processing and improves sleep, which helps. We use much lower doses than for depression — often starting 10 to 25 mg at night and titrating up as needed.
P: Side effects?
D: Commonly drowsiness, dry mouth, weight gain, constipation, and sometimes dizziness. Most begin early and often improve over weeks. If cognitive blunting is a concern, we can go slowly or consider alternatives like venlafaxine, though that has its own profile.
P: I do need to stay sharp for work. I'd prefer to avoid anything that fogs me during the day.
D: Taking it at bedtime usually limits daytime drowsiness. If it affects cognition, we stop and try another approach. Given your preference, I suggest a stepwise plan: start non-pharmacologic measures now, track with a headache diary for four to six weeks, begin physical therapy for neck and shoulder, and consider CBT or biofeedback. If frequency remains high after six to eight weeks, we can start low-dose amitriptyline as a next step.
P: I like the data-driven approach. I'll keep a diary. What should I record?
D: Date, onset time, duration, severity 0–10, what you were doing, caffeine intake that day, any meds you took, and possible triggers. That will help us identify patterns and quantify improvement.
P: I'll do that. Ergonomics — anything specific?
D: Yes. Monitor at eye level, sit with lumbar support, shoulders relaxed, keyboard and mouse within easy reach. Every 30–45 minutes get up and stretch; use the 20-20-20 rule for eyes — every 20 minutes, look 20 feet away for 20 seconds.
P: I already walk in the evenings. PT — what will they do?
D: They will assess posture, neck and shoulder muscle tightness, and prescribe targeted stretches, strengthening, manual therapy, and home exercises. That often reduces muscle tension which fuels these headaches.
P: Bruxism — mouthguard?
D: Yes. A dental assessment and a nighttime guard can reduce clenching and neck strain.
P: What about acupuncture or massage?
D: Massage can help temporarily with muscle tension. Acupuncture shows mixed results but can help some patients. Both are reasonable adjuncts if accessible.
P: And biofeedback — how does that work?
D: You learn to recognize and control muscle tension and physiological responses with real-time feedback. Studies show it reduces frequency and disability for tension-type headaches.
P: If I start amitriptyline later, how long before we know if it works?
D: We’d give it 6–8 weeks at an effective dose to assess benefit. Start low to reduce side effects; many patients notice improvement in sleep and frequency within a few weeks.
P: If it doesn't work?
D: Then we consider alternatives — venlafaxine, referral to neurology for second-line options, or combination therapy. Also reassess for other headache types.
P: Any reason to worry about imaging later?
D: If you develop red-flag symptoms — sudden severe change, focal deficits, new seizures, progressive neurologic symptoms, systemic signs — we'll get MRI. Right now, with a normal exam and typical history, imaging isn't expected to help.
P: Fair.
D: I'd also recommend addressing sleep hygiene and anxiety — a short referral for CBT that targets worry and insomnia could help both sleep and headaches.
P: I appreciate that. I'm conscious of therapy's cost and time, but if CBT reduces these headaches and improves my concentration, it's worth it.
D: Good. I'll give you a referral for physical therapy and a dental referral for bruxism. I'll also send handouts on posture stretches, relaxation exercises, and a headache diary template. Would you like me to prescribe a short supply of amitriptyline now as a contingency, or wait and see after PT and the diary?
P: Let's wait six weeks. Start with PT, diary, sleep hygiene, and mindfulness exercises. If things don't improve, I'll start meds.
D: Sounds reasonable. Limit OTC pain meds to two days a week while you try these measures. If you need acute relief less frequently, use ibuprofen or acetaminophen as directed.
P: Understood. One more thing — are there any simple relaxation techniques I can try immediately?
D: Progressive muscle relaxation and diaphragmatic breathing are good starts. Ten minutes at night or when you feel tension builds can help. I can show you a brief guided script or send a link.
P: Send the link. I like structured things I can measure.
D: Will do. Follow-up in six weeks — we'll review the diary and progress. If headaches worsen or you get any red-flag symptoms sooner, call or come in.
P: Thank you. I'll start the diary today and make the PT appointment.
D: Great. I'll place the referrals and send resources. Anything else on your mind?
P: No. I appreciate the clarity. I'll try to be less heroic about powering through.
D: Good plan. See you in six weeks unless anything changes.
P: See you then.

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Hey Doc! I’m Ethan Baker, ten years old, from suburban Virginia. I love soccer, building giant LEGO sets, and dreaming up new comic heroes. I’m here for a routine asthma check-up because, lately, after soccer I’ve been wheezing and coughing a bit.
D: Hi Ethan, nice to meet you. I’m Dr. Patel. Thanks for telling me what’s been going on. We’ll go over your symptoms and listen to your lungs today.
P: Cool. I want to keep playing as fast as I can. After I sprint for the ball, my chest feels tight and I start coughing. It usually improves if I rest, but not always.
D: Got it. When did you notice the wheezing start, and how many days this week did you have symptoms? Do you wake up any nights with coughing?
P: It started a few weeks ago. This week, I had wheeze after two practices and a little cough after last night’s game. Night coughing happens sometimes when I’m super tired, but most nights I sleep okay.
D: Okay. Do you use your rescue inhaler before games? How often have you used it this week?
P: I used it before practice a couple times this week. Sometimes I’m not sure if I’m supposed to use it before or after I start running. I’m not great at remembering the steps every time.
D: That’s very common. We’ll go over the technique together and check your lungs now.
P: Also, I worry about not fitting in. My sister’s older and faster, and I don’t want to slow the team down. I’m kind of the peacemaker in my friend group—love including everyone in every game.
D: It’s great you look out for your friends. We’ll make a plan that keeps you playing and helps you feel confident.
P: I get impatient when things don’t go my way, especially when I’m tired or not feeling well. But I bounce back fast when my family is cheering me on.
D: I’ll keep that in mind. We’ll set things up so you can stay active and feel supported at home and school.
P: Do I need daily medicine, or can I just use the inhaler before sport?
D: It depends on how well your asthma is controlled. If you have symptoms most days or waking at night, we might consider adding a daily controller medication in addition to your rescue inhaler. If symptoms are limited to occasional exercise-induced wheeze, we may keep it as-needed with a plan.
P: Okay. I’d like to keep up with pizza nights and superhero movies with my dad after practice, too.
D: We’ll make sure your asthma won’t get in the way of that. We’ll also talk about an asthma action plan so you know what to do on good days and on days you feel worse.
P: That sounds good. I love a clear plan.
D: Great. I’ll listen to your lungs now and then we’ll go over your inhaler technique step by step.
P: Okay. I’m ready.
D: Breathe in slowly—now out—that’s perfect. Now another one, nice and steady. I’m going to place the stethoscope on your chest.
P: I can do this. I’ll just pretend I’m a superhero catching air.
D: You’ve got this, Ethan. After I listen, we’ll check your peak flow if you’re up for it and discuss next steps for your exercise plan.
P: Cool. I’m excited to hear what you think and to figure out how to stay fast on the field.
D: We’ll work together to keep you active, safe, and smiling.

D : Hi there, Ethan! It's great to see you too. How are you feeling?
P: Go ahead, Ethan. Tell the doctor what's been going on.
E : It's like... sometimes, when I'm running around at recess, I feel really tired and I wheeze a lot. And my friends are all like ""Come on, Ethan, catch up!"" But I just can't... because it's hard to breathe. *coughs*
D: I see. And have you been using your inhaler more often lately?
E: Yeah... mom reminds me all the time! *laughs* I have to use it before I go outside for gym class or when I'm playing with my friends.
D: Good job using it, Ethan! That really helps. Can you tell me a little bit about what triggers your wheezing? Do you know what makes it worse?
E: Uh-huh... When we're playing outside, and there's lots of dust, or when my friends have pets... and sometimes when I'm at my grandma's house because she has a cat... that makes me wheeze a lot.
D: Okay, that helps me know what we need to keep an eye on. How about at home? Have you been noticing any changes in your breathing when you're at home?
E: Yeah... like when we're dancing, and there's a lot of dust on the floor from the living room... that makes it harder to breathe too. And my siblings like to play with the cat a lot, so I try to stay away... *winks*
D: *laughs* I'm glad you're aware of your triggers, Ethan! Let me take a listen to your lungs real quick, okay? *listening sounds*
D: Everything sounds good, Ethan! Your mom and I will talk about adjusting your medication to help you breathe better, especially during school recess. 
P: Sounds great, thank you, Dr. Patel! We really want Ethan to stay healthy and active.
E: Yeah! Because... *starts singing and dancing* ""I wanna be the very best, like no one ever was...!"" *laughs*
D: *laughs* Well, it's good to see your spirit's not dampened, Ethan! Keep taking care of yourself, and you can be anything you want to be.
P: Let's get you home now, okay?

qwen2.5:14b,,"P: Good morning, Doctor. It’s nice to see you again after such a long time. I hope there isn’t too much paper work today—my to-do list at home is already overflowing.
D: Hello Karen! Glad to see you. How have you been since your last visit? Do the same symptoms persist?
P: Well, honestly, I feel like my energy levels are lower than usual. And with this winter season, it’s just been harder to keep up with gardening and cooking. It’s frustrating because my weight has fluctuated a bit too.
D: I understand how that can impact your day-to-day activities. We’ll start by checking your thyroid hormone levels today. Just remember, managing hypothyroidism is all about finding the right balance of medication.
P: Yeah, it seems like a fine line at times. Could we maybe talk more about diet and exercise as part of this too? I’ve been trying different things but haven’t found much that helps with my energy levels.
D: Absolutely. Diet often plays a crucial role, especially since your thyroid controls metabolism. We should look into making your meals rich in foods like fish, eggs—high-quality protein that supports thyroid health. Exercise is good for you too, if done moderately and consistently. 
P: That sounds sensible. And you know me—I love trying new things out! Maybe some light yoga or walking could fit better than heavier workouts.
D: Perfectly suited to your lifestyle! We’ll adjust your medication based on the results of today’s tests, but incorporating physical activity might offer additional benefits for your energy and weight management.
P: Alright, I’m open to it. The key is finding something enjoyable so that sticking with it doesn’t feel like a chore.
D: Exactly right. You might also find some relief through smaller, manageable steps instead of big changes all at once. How’s work treating you these days?
P: Work has its ups and downs as usual, but I do enjoy the challenge of analyzing data to help our business run smoothly. Still, this hypothyroid thing sneaks up on me, especially with those long hours.
D: Keeping an eye out for signs like that is smart. We’ll keep monitoring your progress and adjust accordingly to ensure you can maintain a healthy work-life balance.
P: That’s what I’m hoping for—balance in everything. Thanks so much, doc! Hopefully we can catch up again this time next year if all goes well.
D: Sounds good, Karen. Remember our conversation today and don’t hesitate to reach out if anything seems off in between visits. Stay positive!
P: Will do. Take care, Doctor. See you next year and I’ll bring some of those exotic sauces we’ve been talking about experimenting with lately.
D: Looking forward to it! Have a great week, Karen.

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Hi Dr. Patel! I’m Ethan Martinez, 10 years old, in the third grade. I’m super excited to be here—my feet are twinkling with dance ideas already.
D: Hi Ethan! I’m Dr. Patel. It’s nice to meet you. I hear you’ve had some wheezing during play lately—let’s see how your lungs are doing.
P: Yeah! It happened at recess when I was chasing my friend. My chest felt tight and I had to slow to a walk; I could hear a wheeze that sounded like a whistle in a video game.
D: That sounds like something we should check out. Have you needed to use your rescue inhaler recently?
P: A couple of times last week after practice and once at school. I always keep it in my backpack now, mom says it’s like a super gadget.
D: That’s great you’re keeping it with you. We’ll also check your inhaler technique today so you’re getting the most from it.
P: I can show you how I use it. I’ve practiced in the mirror like I’m in a musical. My little sister lip-syncs along and I pretend we’re on a stage.
D: I’d love to see your technique. We’ll go through it step by step and then do a quick breath test.
P: Also, I love listening to pop and K-pop while I dance goofy with my siblings. Sometimes the music makes me forget I’m supposed to slow down, but I still want to run and laugh a lot.
D: Music is a good trick to stay motivated. We’ll make sure your asthma plan supports your active lifestyle, including dancing and gym class.
P: At school I worry I’ll miss stuff—mainly because I don’t want to sit quietly for long projects. My teachers say I’m creative, but group work is hard when I can’t breathe well.
D: I hear you. We’ll tailor your plan so you can keep joining in without getting overwhelmed. Let’s talk about how you’ve been feeling day to day.
P: Some days I feel fine, some days I wake up with a cough or a tight chest. The wheeze feels worse when it’s cold or when I’m running a lot.
D: Okay. Do you notice any triggers at home—like dust, smoke, or pets—or is it mostly during exercise?
P: Mostly exercise and cold air. Also during pollen season my nose and lungs get fuzzy, and I sneeze a bunch.
D: That helps us. We’ll consider your environment and a plan that covers exercise-induced symptoms and seasonal changes.
P: My family is mixed heritage, and we learn songs from both sides at gatherings. I love singing and sometimes I make up little stories when I tell my friends about adventures with dragons and heroes.
D: That’s lovely. A calm, happy environment helps. We’ll keep your plan simple so you can continue to express yourself and stay active.
P: I scored okay on the peak flow last time, but I want to do better. Can we test it today to see where I’m at?
D: Yes. We’ll do a quick peak flow check and then listen to your lungs with a stethoscope. Breathe in through your nose, out through your mouth, nice and steady.
P: Okay. Breathe in… and out… like I’m blowing out a candle on my birthday cake after I make a big dance move.
D: Good job. Now one more time, a bit deeper. Excellent. Your lungs sound clear overall, but we’ll address the wheeze you felt during play.
P: My albuterol inhaler helps, but I’m worried about needing it all the time. Will I have to take medicine every day?
D: Most kids with asthma don’t need daily medicine unless there are frequent symptoms. We’ll decide based on today’s tests and your peak flow. If we do add something daily, it’s to prevent symptoms, not to “fix” a problem after it happens.
P: If I do need something daily, will it be scary or make me feel different?
D: Not scary at all. Many kids use a low-dose inhaled controller medicine, and you’ll learn how to use it with a spacer—just like you use your rescue inhaler, but it helps reduce the underlying inflammation.
P: I’m kind of worried about missing school or practice. I don’t want asthma to steal my fun.
D: We’ll put a plan in place to help you stay active. Carry your rescue inhaler, know your asthma action steps, and we’ll set daily goals based on how you feel.
P: My sister and I have a dance routine we’re working on. If I’m short of breath, can I pause and still join in later?
D: Absolutely. It’s better to rest a bit and then resume. We’ll teach you signs to watch for and how to pace yourself during activities.
P: Do you think we should switch anything up, like a daily medicine or a different inhaler?
D: We’ll review today’s results. If your symptoms are more frequent or recent, we might adjust the controller dose or add a nasal- or allergy-related part of the plan depending on what helps most. You’ll have an asthma action plan you can follow at home and at school.
P: I have a lot of questions. Can I write them down and bring them to the next visit if I forget?
D: Of course. We can give you a kid-friendly plan and a small notebook for reminders. Do you want me to show you your inhaler spacer technique again now?
P: Yes, please. I want to be sure I’m doing it right.
D: Great. Let’s go through it slowly together. Place the spacer on the inhaler, breathe in slowly, press once, and breathe out slowly. Repeat as directed.
P: I got it. It’s like syncing a game move with a controller—one press at the right time.
D: Exactly. You’re a fast learner. We’ll back you up with a plan that fits your playtime and school schedule.
P: So what happens next? Do I come back soon?
D: We’ll review your results today, update your inhaler technique if needed, and set a follow-up in about 3 months unless there’s something urgent. If you have more wheeze or coughing, you should contact us sooner.
P: I’m glad I came. I feel hopeful I can keep dancing and playing with my friends.
D: I’m glad you’re here too, Ethan. You’ve got a big heart and a big voice—let’s make sure your lungs can keep up with both.
P: Thanks, doctor. I’ll practice the inhaler with my sister and aim for a new peak flow high score.
D: You’ve got this. See you in a few months, and bring any questions or notes you’ve got. Have a great day, Ethan.

gpt-4.1,,"P: Hi, Dr. Samuels! Whoa, that poster about the skeleton is awesome. Did you know the foot has, like, a zillion bones? Well, not a zillion, but you know… a lot!
D: Hi Eli, I’m glad you like the poster! There are actually 26 bones in each foot. So, how are you doing today? I hear you’ve been having some trouble while dancing?
P: Yeah… it’s kinda annoying, actually. I love, love, love dancing—hip-hop is my favorite! But lately, my chest gets tight and I start coughing when I do the fast songs. Sometimes even after I stop, I’m still wheezing. My mom makes me sit out, but that’s no fun.
D: That sounds frustrating. How often do you have these coughing spells or feel short of breath when you’re dancing?
P: Hmm… It happens almost every time practice gets intense. Like, last week, I was learning this cool spin from a video and—bam!—my lungs were just, like, “Nope!” And then my coach told me to take a break, again. I kind of wish my lungs would just let me dance. Oh, and sometimes it happens at recess, too, if I run a lot.
D: I see. How long does it usually take for your breathing to go back to normal after you rest?
P: Uh… maybe 10, 15 minutes? Sometimes I use the blue inhaler—two puffs, like you told me last time. It helps, but not right away. Also, I feel super tired afterward. Like, almost as if I’d just ran a marathon even though I really didn’t.
D: That’s helpful to know. Have you had these symptoms at night, like waking up coughing or feeling tightness in your chest?
P: Not at night, not really. It’s mostly right after dancing or running. Oh! Sometimes when it’s cold and I go outside, it happens faster, like my chest forgets how to be normal.
D: Thank you for explaining all that, Eli. Have you noticed anything else, like if you get a cold, does it make your breathing worse or last longer?
P: Oh, man, when I had a cold last month, it was totally worse. Like, I could barely get through my TikTok dance before wheezing. Plus, I hate being sick because then my sister tries to take over my dance spot in the living room. She thinks she’s the star, but I know all the moves!
D: You clearly have a lot of fun together! How are you doing with your inhaler? Are you using it only before practice, or just when you get symptoms?
P: Um… So, sometimes I forget to take it before practice unless Mom reminds me . Mostly, I use it when I start feeling that tight feeling. But maybe I should remember before, huh? It’s just, I get excited and kind of… forget.
D: That’s very common, Eli! It's important to try to use your inhaler about 15 minutes before any activity you know will make you short of breath. Would you like to make a plan together so it’s easier to remember?
P: Yes, please! Maybe I can set an alarm before dance class? Or make a sticky note on my game controller—since I always see that.
D: Those are excellent ideas! I think either one could work well. Also, let’s talk about if we should adjust your medication a little to help you breathe easier. Is there anything you're worried about or want to ask?
P: Um… Will I not be able to dance if my asthma gets worse? ‘Cause I really, really don’t wanna stop. Dancing makes me feel like… I don’t know… like a superhero. Or like I’m on the stage of ""America’s Got Talent"" or something. Except in the living room.
D: I love how you described that, Eli! Most kids with asthma can do all their favorite activities with the right plan and medicine. We just want you to feel your best. Would you like to learn a few ways to keep your asthma under control so you can keep dancing?
P: Yes! Teach me all the secret tricks. And maybe something for nerves, too? 'Cause doctor visits make my stomach do weird flips, not the cool dance kind.
D: That’s very brave of you to say, Eli. We can definitely talk about both. For now, let’s work on a step-by-step plan for your asthma and maybe even some quick calming moves you can use here—or on stage someday.

gpt-5,medium,"P: Good morning, doctor. I’m early, as usual. Old habits and symphony call times, I suppose.
D: Morning, Kathleen. How are you feeling today?
P: Mostly fine, though I’ve had a few episodes of lightheadedness that made me clutch the kitchen counter like it was my dance partner. Hence the visit.
D: I’m glad you came in. Tell me more about the lightheadedness—when does it happen, how long does it last, and what does it feel like?
P: It’s a whoosh. The room grays out at the edges for maybe ten, fifteen seconds. Usually when I stand up after chopping vegetables or after a hot shower. Once in the lobby at the symphony, packed with people and perfumes. No fainting, but close enough to make me mutter a prayer my mother would recognize.
D: Any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, headache, or vision loss with these episodes?
P: No chest pain. Breathing’s fine. I get a little flutter at night once in a while, but I chalk that up to too much thinking—and maybe the second glass of Pinot. No headaches, just the gray shimmer. It passes if I pause.
D: How many episodes in the last two weeks?
P: Three memorable ones, and a few little wobbles I took as “sit down, Kathleen” moments.
D: Understood. Let’s talk about your blood pressure readings at home. Have you been checking?
P: Religiously. Mornings are usually in the 120s over mid-70s. Evenings creep up—130s, sometimes tipping into 140/90 if I’ve had a long board meeting or a salty cheese board. I know, I know.
D: What time are you taking your blood pressure medication, and remind me which one you’re on?
P: Lisinopril with a little diuretic—hydrochlorothiazide. The combo pill. I’ve been taking it at night because the morning is a bit of a swirl.
D: Any missed doses?
P: One last week. I was at a gallery opening, came home buzzing, and fell asleep on the sofa. Woke up to “La Vie en Rose” and a guilty conscience.
D: How about fluids—how much water are you drinking daily?
P: Too little, probably. Two cups of coffee, a sparkling water or two, tea in the afternoon. I’m not sloshing, let’s put it that way.
D: Alcohol intake on a typical week?
P: One glass most nights, two if friends are over or the violin solo is particularly transcendent. Maybe four nights a week.
D: Any new medications or over-the-counter supplements? Decongestants, herbal teas, pain relievers?
P: Fish oil, turmeric, vitamin D. Ibuprofen for a cranky knee after yoga once or twice a week. No decongestants. I learned that lesson in the 90s.
D: Exercise routine?
P: Walks along the Charles, yoga twice a week, and I take the stairs when I can. I’m not training for a marathon, but I move.
D: Any falls?
P: No. I grab a counter, breathe, and wait it out. Living alone makes you very aware of gravity.
D: That makes sense. Today your seated blood pressure is 128/76, heart rate 72. Standing, blood pressure drops to 110/70 with a heart rate of 92, and you said you felt a little wobbly. That suggests some orthostatic drop, possibly from the diuretic and hydration.
P: So it’s not just me being dramatic. Good to know.
D: Not at all dramatic. Have you noticed this is worse after hot showers, alcohol, or standing in warm crowded rooms?
P: Yes to all three. The gala season is not orthostasis-friendly.
D: Here’s what I’m thinking: the diuretic may be contributing. We can adjust your regimen, increase hydration, and be strategic about standing up slowly. How would you feel about removing the diuretic portion for a short trial and monitoring your readings closely?
P: If it means I can get through a shower without seeing stars, I’m on board. But I don’t want my numbers climbing like a tenor.
D: We’ll keep a close eye. I’ll switch you to lisinopril alone, same dose, taken in the morning. Hold the diuretic for now. Check your blood pressure twice daily—morning and evening—for two weeks. Bring me the log, or send it through the portal.
P: Morning dose, got it. I can set a reminder between coffee and the crossword.
D: I’d also like labs today—electrolytes, kidney function, complete blood count, and thyroid—to make sure nothing else is influencing this. And we’ll do an EKG to be thorough.
P: Fine by me. Poke away. I wore a blouse with sensible sleeves.
D: Hydration-wise, aim for at least six to eight glasses of water a day, more on active or hot days. Try to rise slowly from crouching or bed. If you feel lightheaded, sit or lie down right away.
P: Understood. No more dramatic kitchen pirouettes.
D: Let’s also be mindful of alcohol—try to limit to one drink on days you have events, and avoid hot showers immediately afterward.
P: I can trade the second glass for a seltzer with a twist. Feels festive enough.
D: Any big salt sources sneaking into your gourmet repertoire?
P: Guilty of olives, anchovies, and a righteous Parmigiano. I season thoughtfully, but the nibble plates get me.
D: Keep the overall sodium moderate. You can lean on herbs, citrus, and vinegar for flavor. Most days you’re doing well—just watch the charcuterie nights.
P: Consider the cheese plate demoted to special occasions.
D: About the nighttime palpitations—if they persist or worsen, or if you develop chest pain, shortness of breath, or you faint, call me right away or go to the ER. That’s nonnegotiable.
P: Message received. If I hit the floor, I’m not trying to be stoic about it.
D: Good. Do you feel your anxiety has been higher lately?
P: A bit. The divorce paperwork is done, but sometimes the quiet in the condo hums louder than I do. I’m fine most days; some nights feel long.
D: Would you be open to a therapist referral or a mindfulness program? It can help with both anxiety and blood pressure.
P: Yes. I’d like a name or two—someone who won’t tell me to stop going to the theater.
D: I’ll send referrals and a short mindfulness resource list. Also, consider compression stockings if you’ll be standing for long periods at events.
P: Glamorous. But if they’re under floor-length black, who will know?
D: Exactly. Quick safety check: do you have a plan if you feel unwell at home?
P: Phone within reach, a neighbor across the hall who’s lovely, and my children are on speed dial. I’ll sit, breathe, and call if things don’t settle.
D: Perfect. We’ll see how you do without the diuretic, focus on hydration, and review your log in two weeks. If your evening numbers spike consistently over 140/90, send me a note sooner.
P: Will do. If I behave, may I keep my Saturday matinee?
D: Absolutely. Just hydrate, go easy on alcohol, and stand up slowly at intermission.
P: Deal. Thank you for meeting me where I live—somewhere between the spice rack and the symphony.
D: My pleasure, Kathleen. We’ll get this steadied. Any other questions today?
P: Just one: may I hum my way to the lab?
D: Strongly encouraged. And don’t forget your water bottle.
P: On it. See you in two weeks.

gpt-4.1,,"P: Good afternoon, Dr. Saunderson. Thanks for squeezing me in. I know we're both running on less-than-ideal schedules these days.
D: Of course, Terrence—happy to see you. How have things been since our last visit? I see from your chart that you’ve been dealing with more frequent migraines lately?
P: Yeah, that’s the gist of it. I’ve gone from maybe one or two headaches a month to now being sidelined several times a week, sometimes for the better part of a day. They’re more intense, too—like, full-on train-through-the-temple kind of pain, with the usual light sensitivity and a bit of nausea. It’s... throwing a wrench into my work, honestly.
D: That sounds really tough, especially given your research commitments. Can you tell me when these migraines typically come on? Any patterns—time of day, after certain activities, stress?
P: Mmm. Funny enough, there is a bit of a pattern. They tend to hit late afternoon or right before bed—usually after long stretches at the computer running data sets, or following a marathon writing session. Stress doesn’t help, but I wouldn’t say it’s the only trigger. Skipping meals and poor sleep probably contribute; both are admittedly in the “needs improvement” column for me.
D: Have you noticed any new symptoms, like vision changes, confusion, or weakness on one side?
P: No, nothing that dramatic. I get the classic aura—flashing lights, sometimes a weird tingly feeling in my fingers. But I haven’t had any trouble with speech or motor stuff, just the usual fogginess that comes before the pain hits. Once it peaks, lying in a dark room is my only option.
D: How long do these migraines usually last?
P: If I catch it early and take something, it’s maybe four hours. If it sneaks up on me, it can wipe out my evening and sometimes I wake up the next day still not quite right. The recovery feels slower—like a bad hangover, but less fun.
D: Are you still using over-the-counter meds, or have you needed to take anything stronger?
P: Mostly ibuprofen, sometimes Tylenol if I run out. I know I’m probably pushing the safe limit. I tried sumatriptan once; it helped, but left me feeling pretty groggy. I haven’t been keeping regular logs—should I be tracking everything?
D: Keeping a headache diary would definitely help. We can talk more about medication options, too. What about other lifestyle changes—any luck with diet, hydration, or managing screen time?
P: In theory, yes. In practice… not so much. It’s hard to step away when I’m deep in research mode, but I know that’s not sustainable. My uncle has taken to barging into my room with sandwiches, which helps the whole “don’t skip lunch” initiative. I’m open to suggestions. I’d really like to find a middle ground that protects my brain and my work.
D: It's good to hear your family is supportive. We’ll review your options: preventive medication, maybe some non-pharmacologic strategies like cognitive-behavioral therapy, and ways to limit screen time when possible. Are you open to trying a daily preventive medication, or would you prefer to adjust lifestyle first?
P: Honestly, I’m at the point where I’ll try whatever offers some relief. If a preventive med makes sense, I’m onboard. Academic deadlines don’t wait for migraines, unfortunately. But I’m also not opposed to working on mindfulness or other strategies—if they fit alongside my schedule.
D: That’s great. I’ll set you up with a prescription and refer you to a behavioral therapist who specializes in chronic headache management. I’ll also give you information on headache diaries and tips for managing triggers. Any other concerns, or questions about what we’ve discussed?
P: Not at the moment—you’ve covered the bases. I appreciate that you’re helping me look at the big picture, not just the pain. I’ll genuinely try to roster in those breaks… even if my research says otherwise. Thanks, Doc.
D: You’re welcome, Terrence. Don’t hesitate to call if things change, or if you have any side effects. We’ll follow up in six weeks. Take care of yourself, and good luck with your next article!
P: Will do. If my uncle makes me take another nap, I’ll consider it doctor’s orders. See you soon.

gpt-5-nano,medium,"P: Good morning, Dr. Patel. I'm Michelle Harper. My hands woke me up again last night with that stiff, achy feeling, and I want to go over my latest labs and what we can do about it.
D: Good morning, Michelle. You’re humming already—nice touch. Let’s review what’s changed and what your tests show.
P: The stiffness hits my fingers first thing, especially my thumbs and index/middle fingers. It eases with movement, but the relief doesn’t last. It’s making work tasks—typing, annotating spreadsheets—harder, and Sunday cooking starts to irritate the joints too.
D: I hear you. We’ve looked at your labs; there’s no sign of inflammatory arthritis. Your vitamin D is a bit low, but nothing alarming. Imaging shows some OA changes in the hand joints, most notably at the thumb base.
P: Right—this matches what I’ve been feeling. I’ve tried heat pads, gentle stretches, and I’ve been careful with hand positioning at my desk, but the pain is creeping into hobbies I love.
D: We’ll tailor a plan that supports both work and life. First, nonpharmacologic strategies: splints for the thumb and possibly a finger splint at night; occupational therapy for grip and joint protection; a structured hand exercise program; heat before activity and ice after heavy use; and ergonomic tools for kitchen tasks.
P: I can do that. I’m already in yoga and I’ll add hand-focused routines. I’d also appreciate a splint I can wear during the day when I need to type for long periods.
D: I’ll arrange a wrist/hand splint fitting and refer you to occupational therapy to build a personalized grip routine. Now about medications: acetaminophen is a safe baseline for you, and a topical NSAID such as diclofenac gel can be used on the hands. Given your GI history with NSAIDs, we’ll start conservatively.
P: I’d like to avoid systemic NSAIDs if possible, so that sounds good. If acetaminophen isn’t enough, what would you suggest next?
D: If pain persists, we could add a low-dose topical NSAID and reassess after about six weeks. If that still doesn’t give relief, we might consider a corticosteroid injection into the affected joints for short-term relief, or a short course of a more targeted oral agent under supervision. We’d be careful about risks and monitor kidney function and blood pressure.
P: A shot in the finger joints—that’s not pleasant, but I understand it can help. If we can get ahead of more damage, that’s worth it.
D: Exactly. We’ll try the least invasive options first and escalate only if needed. How is your sleep these days? I know stress and insomnia can amplify pain perception.
P: My sleep isn’t great; I carry work thoughts into the night. I’m trying to wind down earlier and do a short stretch routine before bed, but the mind just wanders.
D: Managing stress and sleep is part of OA care. Consider a consistent wind-down routine, limit screen time two hours before bed, and try a warm bath or tea. If needed, we can discuss a sleep study referral or melatonin short-term.
P: I’d prefer practical steps I can implement this week. Also, with garden season starting, I want to know how to keep gardening from aggravating the hands.
D: For gardening, use ergonomic tools with padded handles, take breaks, and alternate tasks. A supportive grip or extended-handled tools can reduce strain. I’ll give you a simple home program you can do between shifts at work.
P: That sounds ideal. My friends would joke I’m “the most resilient guitarist of the arthritis world,” but I’d rather be playing in tune than dealing with pain.
D: Your resilience is a strength. We’ll capture that in your plan. Let’s schedule a follow-up in six to eight weeks, review any new labs if necessary, and check in on your function at work and home.
P: Perfect. I’ll start the splint, the topical NSAID, and the home hand routine, and I’ll text you if there’s any sudden flare-up or if the pain worsens.
D: Excellent. If you’d like, we can also set up a quick telehealth check-in in four weeks to adjust the plan. Anything else you want to discuss today?
P: Not today. I feel heard, and I appreciate a plan that respects both my professional efficiency and my love of living well.
D: Great to hear. I’ll see you soon, Michelle. And keep the jazz coming; it’s good medicine.

Meta-Llama-3.1-405B-Instruct,,"P: Good morning, Doctor. I hope you're doing well. It's good to see you again.
D: Good morning, Michelle. It's always a pleasure. How have you been since our last visit? Any changes with the joint pain?
P: Honestly, it's been increasingly frustrating. Simple tasks like cooking dinner or even typing reports at work are becoming a chore. The stiffness is just...lingering.
D: I see. Can you give me an idea of when you first started noticing this? Was there a particular incident that triggered it?
P: Well, I'd say it started a few months ago, around the same time I planted my spring garden. At first, it was just a slight ache after a long day. I attributed it to overexertion, but now...now it's an everyday thing. Even holding a book is uncomfortable.
D: I've reviewed your latest lab results. It appears the osteoarthritis in your hands has progressed slightly. I'd like to discuss some options for pain management and treatment.
P: I anticipated as much. What are my options, Doctor? I'd like to explore something beyond just ibuprofen. This is starting to impact my work and hobbies in a significant way.
D: One possibility is physical therapy to maintain joint mobility. I can also prescribe a stronger pain reliever or recommend injections for inflammation. We should also consider discussing lifestyle changes, such as adjusting your gardening and cooking techniques.
P: Physical therapy, you say? That sounds reasonable. And yes, please, go ahead with the prescription for the pain reliever. I'll need to research those new techniques you mentioned...although, I'm not sure I can envision gardening without my trusty trowel.
D: Well, I'm sure we can find some alternatives that work for you, Michelle. Now, let's take a closer look at your hands and discuss a follow-up plan.
P: Sounds good. And, Doctor? I've been reading a bit about various supplements, glucosamine and the like. What's your take on those?
D: Some people find them helpful in alleviating symptoms. I'd be happy to provide you with some recommendations, but it's essential to have realistic expectations about their effectiveness.
P: Understood. I simply want to explore every available avenue at this point. You know, I've been meaning to ask...do you think this will significantly hinder my ability to play piano in the long run?
D: Playing piano is a goal of yours?
P: Oh, more of an old aspiration, really. I've taken lessons on and off over the years, and while I'm no virtuoso, I do find it's a great stress reliever...what with the jazz, you know.
D: While osteoarthritis may require you to adjust your approach, there's no reason to give up on playing piano altogether. We'll work on managing your symptoms, and with the right adaptations, I'm sure you can continue enjoying music for years to come.
P: Thank you, Doctor. That means a great deal to me.
D: Now, shall we schedule that follow-up appointment and get started on the treatment plan?
P: Sounds like a plan, Doctor.

gpt-5-mini,high,"P: Morning, Doctor. I’d greet you with a hug but my legs have been auditioning for a taser commercial lately.
D: Hi Sarah. Sorry to hear that — tell me what’s been happening with your pain.
P: It’s been creeping up over the last three months. Lower back and both legs — burning, stabbing, like tiny electricity bolts. It wakes me at night. The gabapentin I’m on isn’t cutting it anymore. Some days I can still haul myself up a wall; other days I can’t stand long enough to take a decent photograph. Not ideal.
D: How long have you been on gabapentin and what dose?
P: Since the accident, on and off. For the last year I’ve been steady at 600 mg three times a day. I take amitriptyline ten at night for sleep sometimes. I try to avoid opioids; had a short course of tramadol months ago and decided that life’s duller with it. I’m worried I’ll have to choose between being awake and being mobile.
D: Any new weakness, numbness interfering with walking, bowel or bladder changes?
P: No new bowel or bladder issues — thank God. My legs feel weaker when the pain flares, but that’s probably the pain, not true weakness. I can still transfer and do adaptive climbing, though it’s getting riskier. I worry about falling.
D: Any fever, weight loss, or recent infections?
P: No fever, no weird weight change — apart from the occasional cake at the parish bake sale. I volunteer; I can’t stop baking for them.
D: Any recent imaging? When was your last MRI?
P: Last full spine MRI was probably three, maybe four years ago. After the accident they scanned everything; I haven’t had a recent one since symptoms changed slowly. This feels different — more intense, more constant.
D: Have you tried physical therapy, TENS, acupuncture, injections, or seen a pain clinic?
P: PT is my religion — well, church is my religion, PT is my confession. I do adaptive PT and strength work regularly. I’ve used TENS. I did try one epidural steroid injection a couple years back — not much luck. I’ve dabbled with acupuncture; my acupuncturist swears by tea, which I also swear by.
D: How is your sleep and mood? You mentioned earlier that some days are harder emotionally.
P: Sleep is rubbish when the pain spikes. Mood dips happen; I have my anxious moments about the future — money, health, the whole package. But my church group is brilliant, and my friends keep me honest. I pray. I rant at God occasionally — He can take it. Mostly I try not to be defined by this. I’m stubborn that way.
D: I hear you. Pain flares that disrupt sleep and function are significant. I’d like to do a few things: get updated imaging to rule out any new structural issues, check labs including kidney function so we dose medications safely, and refer you to our multidisciplinary pain clinic for further options. Is that okay?
P: That sounds sensible. Will the imaging tell us if something new is pressing on the cord? I’m not keen on surprises.
D: Yes. Given your history, an MRI of your thoracic and lumbar spine would be prudent. It can show new compression, scarring, or a syrinx that could be contributing. While we wait, I’d also like to rethink your meds so you aren’t choosing between pain control and getting tossed off a wall.
P: Thank you. I want to stay active. Sedation is my enemy. I love climbing and skiing with adaptive instructors — I’m not ready to hang up the harness.
D: Understood. Options include optimizing or switching meds. We could consider trying duloxetine, which helps neuropathic pain and can improve mood and sleep, and may be less sedating than increasing gabapentin. Alternatively, switching from gabapentin to pregabalin is an option for some people. Ultimately, a pain specialist can discuss ketamine infusions, spinal cord stimulation trials, or intrathecal therapies if conservative measures fail. I’ll steer us toward the least disabling options first.
P: Ketamine? Spinal cord stimulator? Sounds sci‑fi. Do they work?
D: Some people get meaningful relief. The evidence varies; for central neuropathic pain after spinal cord injury, responses can be mixed. A spinal cord stimulator trial can test whether stimulation helps before committing surgically. Ketamine infusions can help refractory neuropathic pain for some patients, but it’s specialist territory. That’s why I’d like you seen at the pain clinic.
P: I like the idea of a trial first. Also, the practical side: these gadgets and infusions — do they break the bank? I’ve been off work for a while and the worry about long-term costs gnaws at me.
D: That's a valid concern. We can involve our social worker early. They help with insurance pre-authorizations, explore assistance programs, and see if your disability benefits or church groups can help with transportation or costs. I don’t want financial worries to stop you from getting appropriate care.
P: Good. I can handle physical things; paperwork is my kryptonite. Also — small thing — will duloxetine interact with my amitriptyline?
D: We need to be cautious about combining serotonergic agents. If we start duloxetine, I’d typically taper off the amitriptyline first, or adjust under close monitoring. Also we’ll check your blood pressure and review your full medication list. Renal function matters for gabapentin dosing too.
P: Fine. I’d rather have less brain fog at a climb than an extra pill. Also, practical question: if we do an SCS trial, will I still be able to wear a harness, get photographs from odd angles, and host movie nights?
D: Most patients with stimulators continue active lifestyles, including climbing and skiing, but we’d coordinate with the device company and your adaptive instructors. There are considerations around impact activities and certain therapies. We’d plan around your hobbies.
P: That’s a relief. I’m not giving up hosting movie nights or my political tirades easily.
D: Good. For now, immediate plan: order MRI thoracic and lumbar spine, basic labs including CMP and renal function, and refer you to the pain clinic and to physiatry. I can also give a short prescription change if you want to try duloxetine, but we can wait until labs come back and we decide whether to taper the amitriptyline. How does that sound?
P: Sounds thorough. Let’s do the imaging and labs first. I’m game to try duloxetine if it means fewer electric shocks and less sitting on the sofa like some sort of tragically bored iceberg.
D: I’ll get the orders in today. I’ll also put in the referral to the pain clinic and a request for a social work consult. If the MRI shows something we need to act on urgently, I’ll call you immediately.
P: Thank you. I appreciate how practical you are. One more thing — spiritual support matters to me. Any chance you can note in the chart that I’d like referrals to peer support groups? My church has been amazing, but other folks’ experience helps.
D: Absolutely. I’ll add a note for peer support and a community resources referral. I can also give you information about local adaptive sports groups and photography meetups if that would help.
P: Please do. Keeps me focused on things I love. Oh — and if I start crying in the waiting room, it’s just emotion from the coffee; not an emergency.
D: Laugh or cry, it’s all allowed. We’ll get started and check back in after your MRI and labs. If the pain becomes unbearable or you develop new neurologic symptoms, call me or go to the ER.
P: Deal. Thank you, Doctor. You’ve given me a plan and hope — which is more effective than any pill, honestly.
D: You’re welcome, Sarah. We’ll work through this together. I’ll see you after the tests or sooner if needed.

gpt-5-nano,high,"P: Good morning, Doctor. I’m Ellen Kovacs.
D: Good morning, Ellen. How have you been since your last visit?
P: Frustrated—my knee pain has worsened, and the stiffness is starting to slow me down in the kitchen and on my weekly arboretum walks.
D: I’m sorry to hear that. On a 0 to 10 scale today, where would you put the pain?
P: Usually 4 to 6 with activity, 2 to 3 at rest. Morning stiffness lasts about 20 to 30 minutes, sometimes longer after a busy cooking session.
D: Any swelling or instability?
P: A bit of swelling after long periods standing at the stove. No locking or giving way. There’s crepitus when I bend.
D: What have you tried so far?
P: Naproxen 500 mg twice daily for months. It helps a bit but not enough lately. I’m mindful of GI and kidney health. I did six weeks of physical therapy last year; it helped, but the gains faded. I haven’t had injections yet, and I’d like to avoid knee replacement if possible.
D: Understood. Let me examine you.
D: 
D: Findings: mild effusion, reduced flexion, crepitus, ligaments stable.
P: So this aligns with osteoarthritis, and it’s starting to interfere with daily tasks. I don’t want surgery if I can avoid it.
D: I hear you. We’ll focus on options that preserve function and minimize risk.
P: I want something that fits my life. I rely on a predictable routine and I’d prefer not to rely on heavy meds long-term.
D: Plan includes several steps. First, we can reduce systemic exposure by using topical therapies.
P: That sounds reasonable. I’m open to alternatives if they work.
D: Step one: topical diclofenac as a local anti-inflammatory. Step two: acetaminophen as baseline pain control, up to about 3 to 4 g per day if tolerated. Step three: a short, carefully monitored NSAID course with a proton-pump inhibitor if GI risk is a concern.
P: I’d rather avoid frequent NSAIDs, but I’ll consider a short course if it helps.
D: Step four: restart a targeted physical therapy program—emphasis on quadriceps strengthening, knee stability, and gait mechanics, plus a home program you can do between sessions.
P: I can do that, and I’ll keep my kitchen tasks in mind during the sessions.
D: Step five: discuss assistive devices or a light knee brace to reduce load during long cooking periods and walks.
P: A brace could help during kneading and long prep days. I’ll need to practice with it.
D: Step six: if pain remains limiting, we can consider a corticosteroid injection for short-term relief or, depending on response, hyaluronic acid injections. Step seven: revisit surgical options if conservative measures fail to restore function.
P: I’d like to try the injections only if necessary and avoid surgery unless there’s no other choice.
D: Finally, we’ll reassess in 6 to 8 weeks, adjust as needed, and keep walking plans intact. If the pain suddenly worsens, swelling grows, or you lose range of motion, contact me sooner.
P: That sounds like a solid plan. I want to keep cooking and stay independent, and I value direct steps I can follow.
D: We’ll support that. I’ll write up the plan and arrange PT and follow-up imaging if needed. Any preferences on the timing or tasks we should prioritize?
P: No surprises; just clear milestones and a realistic pace. And please, if we can avoid surgery, let’s.
D: Agreed. I’ll get this organized and we’ll touch base in six to eight weeks, with options ready if you need them earlier.
P: Thank you, Doctor. I appreciate the straightforward approach.
D: You’re welcome, Ellen. See you soon, and I’ll send you the plan with what to do week by week.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Good afternoon, Doc. Thanks for seeing me today. I’ve been fighting these headaches—migraine-style, you know—for a while now. They’re starting to mess with my work, and honestly, I’d like to get a handle on it before I get totally derailed.
D: Hello, Marcus. I appreciate you coming in. Can you describe these headaches? When do they usually occur, and what do they feel like?
P: Sure. They come on pretty suddenly, usually in the late afternoon, especially after I’ve been staring at reports for a few hours. It’s like this pounding, really intense, on one side of my head. Sometimes the light feels too bright, and I get this weird sensitivity to sound. Clear signs it’s a migraine, I guess.
D: Do you notice any patterns or triggers? Certain foods, stress, sleep changes?
P: Ah, that’s the thing. I keep a pretty tight schedule—it's almost ritualistic. But maybe stress is a factor. I work at a think tank, so plenty of deadlines. And I do tend to skip meals or stay up too late catching up on books or research. As for foods, I haven’t pinpointed anything specific, but I keep a list of possible triggers.
D: Noticing these patterns is helpful. How long do your migraines last, typically?
P: Usually around a few hours, but sometimes they stretch into the evening. The worst part is how they wipe me out—make it hard to focus, even after the throbbing subsides.
D: Do you experience any nausea, visual disturbances, or other symptoms?
P: Nausea, yes. Visual aura, sometimes—like shimmering zigzags before the pain kicks in. That’s been quite unsettling.
D: Understood. Do you have any history of similar headaches in the family?
P: We don’t have much family medical history to go on—my parents are healthy as far as I know, but I don’t think migraines run in the family.
D: That’s okay. Have you tried any treatments or lifestyle modifications so far?
P: I’ve mostly just managed through over-the-counter pain relievers—ibuprofen, you know. But they don’t always cut it, and I worry about overusing them. I’ve tried to keep regular sleep hours, but with everything going on at work, that’s a challenge.
D: It’s good you’re aware of moderation with medications. Given the frequency and impact on your life, I’d like to explore some preventive strategies and possibly prescribe some medication if appropriate. Also, lifestyle adjustments could help.
P: Sounds sensible. I’d rather avoid having these headaches hijack my days. I’m open to whatever works. I guess I’ve just been trying to push through them, but it’s clear I need to change that.
D: That’s a wise step. We can discuss some options—both medication and non-medication. Also, keeping a headache diary might help us identify additional triggers. Would you be willing to start one?
P: Absolutely. I can do that. Maybe even log my sleep, meals, and stress levels. That might shed some light on what’s really going on.
D: Excellent. And if the migraines persist or worsen, we can consider further tests or adjustments. But for now, let’s take a holistic approach and see how you respond.
P: I appreciate that. It feels good to finally get a plan in place. Thanks for taking this seriously.

P: Low energy, almost no motivation. I used to get up, brew strong coffee, grab the camera and chase morning light on rooftops. Lately I hit snooze, my assignments pile up, and even volunteering at the shelter feels like a chore. It started slowly over the last two weeks.
D: Have you been using your light box this year? How did it work for you previously?
P: I bought a 10,000-lux box last winter off a site recommendation. It helped when I actually used it. Problem is I wasn't consistent — some mornings I did 20–30 minutes, sometimes skipped a week. This year I haven't been disciplined; I used it a couple times this week but not every day.
D: When you used it, what time of day and how close did you sit to it?
P: Usually within the morning, but not reliably within the first hour of waking. I'd sit at my kitchen table, coffee in hand, scrolling on my phone. Distance-wise I think it was on the counter a foot or two away. I never stared into it — just kept it in my peripheral.
D: Any side effects from the light therapy — headaches, eye strain, trouble sleeping?
P: Almost none. One morning I had a slight headache, but that could've been too much coffee. My sleep's been messy though — late to bed, late to rise.
D: Have you had previous treatment for depression aside from the light box? Any antidepressants or therapy?
P: I did a short run of therapy when I took a semester off for health reasons last year, but I stopped because of money and schedule. I haven't been on meds.
D: Any history of bipolar disorder or manic episodes? Any thoughts of harming yourself?
P: No history of mania. No — I haven't had suicidal thoughts. When things dip I get stuck and doubt myself, but I haven't been unsafe.
D: Okay. A couple of quick questions — any eye disease or medications that increase light sensitivity?
P: No eye disease. Just occasional allergy meds.
D: Thanks. Based on what you describe, your pattern fits seasonal affective symptoms returning. I want to suggest a few practical adjustments and options. Would that be okay?
P: Yeah, please. I'm open to anything that feels doable. I'm tired of waiting to feel motivated.
D: First, consistency with your light therapy is key. Aim to use a 10,000-lux box every morning within 30 minutes of waking for about 30 minutes. Place it roughly 16–24 inches from your face, angled slightly downward so you don’t look directly into it. You can read, drink coffee, or edit photos while it's on — eyes open, not staring.
P: Morning within 30 minutes — that makes sense. I can put it next to the kettle and brew with it on. Will the box on the counter at that distance be enough?
D: Yes, if it's rated at 10,000 lux at that distance. Check the manufacturer's specs. If it's lower lux, you'll need longer exposure — sometimes 45–60 minutes. If you can't make morning sessions, a dawn simulator that gradually brightens your room is another good option.
P: Good tip about checking the specs. My device is a year old — do they lose strength?
D: They can. Bulbs and LEDs degrade over time. If you're not getting the advertised lux at the recommended distance, consider replacing it. Look for broad-spectrum white light rather than colored LEDs marketed as ""mood lamps.""
P: Got it. Anything else besides the box?
D: Yes — behavioral strategies: keep a regular sleep–wake schedule, even on weekends; try to get 15–20 minutes of natural outdoor light in the morning when possible — even a short rooftop walk with your camera would help; schedule small, concrete tasks for school to counter procrastination; and keep up social contact and volunteering when you can — those are protective.
P: Morning rooftop walks sound doable and even fun. That feels more sustainable than forcing myself through a checklist.
D: Exactly — anchor the light therapy to habits you already enjoy. For example, set the light box on the table while you brew coffee and plan a 10–15 minute walk later in the morning when weather allows.
P: If I do all this and still feel flat, what's next?
D: If there's limited improvement after about 2–4 weeks of consistent light therapy and behavioral changes, we can consider starting medications. Bupropion XL is often used for seasonal patterns because it's activating and can help energy and motivation. SSRIs are also effective for some people. We can discuss pros and cons and make a shared decision if it comes to that.
P: I'm hesitant about meds but also realistic. I'd prefer to try structured light and routine first. Is CBT for SAD different from regular talk therapy?
D: CBT tailored for SAD focuses on behavioral activation, scheduling pleasant activities, and addressing negative thought patterns tied to the season. It has good evidence for preventing and treating SAD. I can refer you to someone who does CBT-SAD or a therapist experienced with behavioral activation.
P: That sounds useful. I liked therapy before when I stuck with it. Cost is a worry, though.
D: I understand. I can help find low-cost options — community clinics, sliding-scale therapists, or telehealth resources. Also, volunteering at the shelter counts as behavioral activation and social connection; try to keep that in your routine if possible.
P: I will. Quick question — vitamin D? People always mention it.
D: We can check a vitamin D level; low levels can contribute but treating deficiency doesn't replace light therapy. I'll order TSH and a vitamin D level to rule out thyroid issues and deficiency while we're at it.
P: Appreciate that.
D: A few safety notes: watch for increased agitation, racing thoughts, or if you suddenly feel overly energetic — rare, but a sign we should stop light therapy and evaluate for bipolar. Also stop and call if you have visual changes or significant eye pain. Otherwise side effects are usually mild — eye strain, headache, jitteriness. If you get those, reduce session length for a few days and taper back up.
P: Okay. I'll watch for that and set the box for mornings only. Any tips for staying consistent?
D: Make it part of an easy morning ritual: light box — coffee — ten-minute photo plan — get dressed — short walk. Set your alarm and place the box where you can't ignore it. Small wins count: even 15 minutes on bad days is helpful.
P: That ritual feels very me. I can do that.
D: Good. Plan: start daily morning light therapy at 30 minutes within 30 minutes of waking, keep a consistent sleep schedule, try morning outdoor light when you can, maintain volunteer contact, and I'll order TSH and vitamin D. If no meaningful improvement in 2–4 weeks, we'll discuss starting medication and refer you for CBT-SAD. I'll schedule a follow-up in two weeks — does that work?
P: Two weeks works. I want to see if I can get back to shooting early again.
D: Great. Before you go — any increase in hopelessness, thoughts of harming yourself, or sudden changes in mood, call me or go to the ER. Otherwise, call the office if you get bothersome side effects or questions about the light device.
P: I won't ignore those. Thanks, Dr. Lee. Feels good to leave with a plan — and a reason to get the camera back out in the morning.
D: You're welcome. Small, consistent steps — you'll be surprised at how much they add up. See you in two weeks.

gpt-5-nano,low,"P: Good morning, doctor. It’s Walter Bradley, from the county line, if you’ll forgive the old country boy’s memory.
D: Morning, Walter. I’m glad you came in. How have you been since our last visit?
P: Well, steady as I can be, mostly. Margaret and I keep to our routine, you know— Sundays at church, small bites of time in the garden, and the guitar waiting for me in the sunroom.
D: I remember you mentioned some dizziness. Tell me what you’ve been feeling.
P: Not always, but some days I’ll stand up and the world tilt a hair. Like I’m walking through a light mist in the kitchen. It don’t last long, but it’s there enough to worry a man.
D: I understand. Any headaches, buzzing, or faintness? And has the dizziness happened more when you’re standing or after meals?
P: Mostly when I rise, and after meals if I’ve eaten heavy—which I try not to do, but I’m not perfect. And there’s a kind of pressure before it eases, not a pain, just a pressure.
D: I appreciate you detailing that. Let’s check your vitals and review your meds. How have your blood pressure readings been at home, if you’ve been taking them?
P: The readings have stayed up. A bit higher than before, I reckon. I’ve kept a log, but I may have missed a couple of days here and there.
D: It’s common to miss days. We’ll look at the numbers together. Any new symptoms—blurred vision, headaches, or shortness of breath?
P: No trouble breathing, and my vision’s been fine. Just the dizziness, and a nagging worry inside about the health of me and Margaret.
D: I’ll tell you straight, Walter: the dizziness could be from your blood pressure, but we’ll rule out other causes too. Have you been taking your medicines as prescribed?
P: Mostly, yes. I’ve stuck with the lisinopril and the low-dose diuretic, but I admit I’ve skipped a dose here and there when the day got busy or I forgot in the evening.
D: Skipping doses can affect blood pressure and balance. We’ll adjust if needed. Any cough from the diuretic, or swelling in your ankles?
P: No cough, no swelling I can tell. I stay mindful, though—the old worry peeks its head in when I notice changes.
D: That worry is familiar. We’ll keep your regimen simple and steady. I’m thinking we might need to adjust your meds or timing, and perhaps add a short-acting option for dizziness if needed.
P: I’d appreciate that. I don’t want this tilt to become a habit. I’ve got too much to lose—not pride, but peace of mind for Margaret and the grandkids.
D: I hear you. We’ll aim for stability. We can consider a small increase in your ACE inhibitor dose or add a calcium channel blocker, depending on your labs and how you’ve tolerated the current meds.
P: That makes sense. I trust you and I trust the routine you see fit for us. It’s a relief to have a plan.
D: I’ll also suggest a few non-drug steps: hydration, rising slowly, and maybe a brief posture routine in the mornings. And if dizziness returns or worsens, we’ll bring you in sooner.
P: I can try that. I’ve always believed in taking care of what’s in front of me—and I’ll keep at the garden, the guitar, and the quiet faith that steadies me.
D: Good. Let’s take a quick look at your labs from the last visit, check your EKG if needed, and we’ll decide on the adjustment. I’ll explain clearly what I’m changing and why.
P: Thank you, doctor. I value listening and clear steps. It’s easier to sleep at night when I know the plan.
D: You’re doing the right thing, Walter. Let’s get you comfortable with the plan today. Any questions you want me to answer right now?
P: Just one: you’ll tell me honestly if you see something serious I should be watching for, right?
D: Absolutely. If there’s anything alarming, I’ll say so right away. You have my word.
P: Then I’m ready. Let’s go over the numbers and we’ll move forward.
D: We'll start with a quick check, and we’ll adjust from there. And I’ll keep you posted every step of the way.

gpt-5-mini,medium,"P: Hi. Thanks for seeing me. I figure it’s time to stop guessing at causes and get a plan. My tension headaches have been getting worse and they’re starting to interfere with work.
D: Hi Elliot. Sorry you’re dealing with that. Can you describe the headaches—where they are, what they feel like, how often, and when they started getting worse?
P: They’re bilateral, like a tight band across my forehead and the back of my head—pressure, not pulsing. No nausea, rarely light sensitivity, no aura. They used to be occasional since college, but for the last three months they’re almost daily. Some days they’re mild enough to push through, others distract me so much I can’t concentrate on coding or reading papers.
D: Daily for three months—okay. Any neck pain or stiffness?
P: Yes, a fair bit of neck stiffness. I sit at a computer for eight to twelve hours a day. I get up sometimes to make coffee, but otherwise I’m hunched. I play online chess in the evenings—more screen time. I also get tension in my jaw occasionally when I’m stressed.
D: Any visual changes, sensory loss, weakness, dizziness, fainting, or trouble speaking?
P: No to all of those. No fevers, no weight loss. Sleep is... inconsistent. I fall asleep fine but wake frequently if I’m worrying about deadlines. I drink coffee—usually two to three cups, sometimes more if I’m on a grant deadline. I’ve tried ibuprofen and acetaminophen; they help a bit but I catch myself taking them several times a week.
D: Any medications or recreational drugs? Any history of migraines in family?
P: No regular meds. No illicit drugs. Family history—my mother had migraines in her twenties, but she mostly had unilateral, throbbing headaches, not this constant band-like thing.
D: Have you tried any non-medical interventions—ergonomic adjustments, physical therapy, massage, relaxation techniques, biofeedback?
P: I moved my monitor once but didn’t see much change. I tried a foam roller and a massage once; it helped for a day. I’ve read about mindfulness and progressive muscle relaxation but haven’t stuck with them. I tend to prefer figuring things out logically, so I’m skeptical of vague “relax more” advice.
D: Understood. On exam your vitals are normal. Neurological exam—cranial nerves, strength, reflexes, coordination—are all intact. No focal deficits. Neck range-of-motion is somewhat restricted and there’s tenderness in the suboccipital muscles and upper trapezius.
P: That fits. So what are we looking at? Tension-type headache? Something structural?
D: This pattern—bilateral, pressing quality, neck muscle tenderness, daily for months—fits chronic tension-type headache. Given your normal neuro exam and no red flags, a structural cause is unlikely right now, so we don’t need MRI immediately. We should monitor for any new concerning signs, though—sudden severe headache, vision changes, focal weakness, fever, progressive vomiting, or change in consciousness—if any of those occur, we’d image right away.
P: Good. I was worried I’d need an MRI. I’d rather not unless necessary. What’s the evidence-based approach? I want something that actually reduces frequency and lets me work.
D: Two-pronged approach: nonpharmacologic and pharmacologic if needed. Start with targeted non-drug measures—ergonomics, posture correction, specific neck exercises, regular movement breaks, sleep and caffeine adjustments, and structured stress management like CBT or guided relaxation. If headaches remain frequent after a trial of those, low-dose preventive medication—amitriptyline—is the first-line option for chronic tension-type headache. Physical therapy focused on cervical muscles can be quite effective too.
P: Can you be specific about ergonomics and exercises? And about amitriptyline—what are the downsides? I can’t afford to be mentally foggy during writing or chess.
D: Ergonomics: monitor top at eye level, about an arm’s length away; keyboard close, wrists neutral; use a chair with lumbar support; sit with hips slightly higher than knees if possible. Take a 5-minute microbreak every 45–60 minutes—stand, walk, do gentle neck mobility. For exercises: daily chin tucks , levator scapulae and upper trapezius stretches , and scapular retraction squeezes . I’ll give you a PT referral; they can tailor a program.
Amitriptyline: start low—typically 10–25 mg at bedtime, then titrate up as needed. It can cause drowsiness, dry mouth, constipation, and sometimes weight gain. Many patients notice improved sleep and reduced headache frequency at low doses, but cognitive slowing can occur in some. We’d aim for the lowest effective dose and monitor you closely, especially since your work requires concentration.
P: If I start amitriptyline and feel sedated, will it impair my cognition long-term, or is it dose-dependent and reversible?
D: Mostly dose-dependent and reversible. If it causes problematic sedation or cognitive effects, we can lower the dose, change timing, or stop it. Alternative preventives exist but have less evidence for tension-type headaches. We can consider them if needed.
P: What about Botox or muscle relaxants? And what about OTC overuse? I worry I’m doing rebound headaches.
D: Botox isn’t supported for tension-type headache the way it is for chronic migraine. Muscle relaxants can help short-term but aren’t great for long-term management due to side effects. Regarding OTC use: medication-overuse headache is a real risk. For simple analgesics like acetaminophen or NSAIDs, try to keep them under 15 days per month; triptans/ergots under 10. Ideally, use them sparingly—reserve for breakthrough pain. Frequent use can perpetuate the cycle.
P: Okay. I can aim to limit analgesics. I’m also trying to be honest with myself—my perfectionism and stress patterns probably contribute. Do psychological approaches actually change headache frequency?
D: Yes. CBT and structured stress-reduction programs have good evidence to reduce frequency and disability in chronic tension-type headache. Biofeedback and progressive muscle relaxation also help. Because you value evidence, a short CBT-based course—six to eight sessions—could be effective. I can refer you to a therapist experienced with headache.
P: I’ll try that. How soon should I expect improvement if I do ergonomics and PT? And if I start amitriptyline, timeline there?
D: With consistent ergonomic changes and PT, some patients feel better in 4–6 weeks, often sooner for pain reduction. For amitriptyline, benefits for headache frequency commonly appear in 4–8 weeks after reaching a therapeutic dose. We’ll set a follow-up in about 6–8 weeks to assess response.
P: If nothing changes after a few months, when do we escalate or refer to neurology?
D: If you’ve tried PT, lifestyle measures, CBT, and a preventive med with inadequate response—or if the headache pattern changes or red flags appear—we’d refer to neurology sooner. Escalation could include trying a different preventive agent or more specialized interventions.
P: One practical question: any specific caffeine guidance? I likely consume more during crunches.
D: Try to limit to one to two standard cups of coffee per day and avoid caffeine in the late afternoon and evening. If you’re consuming a lot now, taper gradually over a week to reduce withdrawal headaches. Keep hydrated.
P: Alright. I’m willing to try the ergonomics, PT, stricter analgesic limits, and CBT. If we add medication, low-dose amitriptyline at night and reassess in six weeks. That sound reasonable?
D: Yes. Plan: physical therapy referral, ergonomic checklist and exercises to start today, CBT referral, limit analgesics to less than 2–3 times per week while we implement other measures, gradual caffeine reduction if needed. If headaches remain frequent after six weeks, start amitriptyline 10–25 mg at bedtime and follow up in 4–6 weeks after starting. If any red flags occur, contact us immediately.
P: One last thing—what should I track in the meantime?
D: Keep a headache diary: date, duration, intensity , probable triggers , medications taken and doses, and any associated symptoms. That will help us see patterns and measure response.
P: I’ll bring that. Thank you. I prefer concise, measurable steps. This plan fits.
D: Good. I’ll place the PT and CBT referrals and give you the handout with exercises and the ergonomics checklist. We’ll book a follow-up in six weeks. Call sooner if things change.
P: Thanks. I feel better having a framework. I’ll start the chin tucks tonight.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Good morning, Doctor. Glad to be here. I’ve been feeling a bit more tired than usual, and those palpitations are still popping up now and then. Just want to make sure everything’s alright with the heart. 
D: Good morning, Walter. I understand your concerns. Let’s go over your symptoms and see what we need to do. How often have the palpitations been happening recently, and have you noticed anything that triggers them more?
P: Well, they come and go, mostly in the afternoons, especially after I’ve been doing some reading or maybe tending the garden. I’ve always been a bit anxious about my heart, but lately, it’s been more noticeable. I worry if it’s something serious.
D: It’s good you’re attentive to these changes. Your atrial fibrillation can cause palpitations and fatigue, but we’ll check your latest EKG and discuss your medication. Have you experienced any dizziness or chest pain along with these episodes?
P: No, thankfully, no dizziness or pain—just the irregular beats and feeling a little drained afterward. Like I said, I’ve been a bit more anxious too, trying not to dwell on it. But I do wonder if I should be worried about the long term.
D: Being vigilant is sensible, Walter. Our goal is to keep your rhythm stable and manage your symptoms. Your current medication seems to be working well, but we’ll review your recent tests and possibly adjust your dose if needed. Is there anything else that’s been bothering you—sleep issues, perhaps?
P: Now that you mention it, my sleep’s been a touch restless lately. I wake up a couple of times during the night, and I sometimes worry my heart’s acting up again. Yet, I try to keep my routine steady, like I always do.
D: Restless sleep can be related to your atrial fibrillation or even anxiety, which is understandable given your concerns. We can discuss strategies to help you relax before bed. Also, I’d like to check your blood pressure and perhaps do a quick exam. Any changes in your diet or activity levels lately?
P: Not really. Still tending my tomatoes and playing my clarinet in the evenings. Music is my refuge, you know. Helps me keep grounded. I do watch what I eat, and I try not to overexert myself.
D: That’s excellent, Walter. Maintaining those routines is beneficial. I’ll review your medications and schedule some additional tests to get a clearer picture. And remember, if anything worsens or if you experience chest pain, dizziness, or increased shortness of breath, you should seek care immediately.
P: Will do, Doctor. I appreciate your thoroughness. Sometimes I worry I’m overreacting, but I guess it’s better to be cautious. I trust we’re doing everything we can to keep my heart stable and allow me to enjoy my music and quiet days.
D: Absolutely. We’ll work together to ensure your heart stays as steady as your gentle nature. Let’s go over your medication plan and arrange those follow-up tests. And don’t hesitate to reach out if you have any concerns between visits.
P: Thank you, Doctor. It’s comforting to know someone’s looking out for me. And I’ll keep my eye on those palpitations—keep my routine, as always.
D: That’s the right approach, Walter. We'll take good care of you.

gpt-5,medium,"P: So, round two of “maybe it’s just gas,” huh?
D: Hey, Ethan. Good to see you. Not gas. I read your chart. Tell me what’s been going on this past month.
P: Same stomach aches. Middle of my belly. Feels like someone twisted the knob to “annoying” and left it there.
D: How often?
P: Most days. Some days it just hangs out. Other days it spikes after lunch, like at school.
D: Any nighttime pain that wakes you up?
P: Not really. I fall asleep fine. If it wakes me, it’s because my cat decides my belly is a trampoline.
D: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation?
P: Nausea sometimes. No puking. Poops are… normal-ish. Not rocks, not soup. No blood. You’re welcome.
D: Thanks. Fever, weight loss, feeling really tired?
P: No fevers. I’m the same size as last time. Tired is just… school.
D: Does it stop you from doing stuff? Games, skating, hanging out with Amelia?
P: I still skate. I just go slower when it cramps. I try to not look like a wimp in front of my sister. She’ll weaponize it.
D: Any patterns—foods, stress, timing?
P: You told me to cut dairy. I did. Almond milk tastes like cardboard’s cousin. Pain didn’t care. Greasy pizza is worse, but everything kind of is.
D: How’s school going otherwise?
P: Fine. Tests are fine. People are people. I just don’t love sitting in class clutching my stomach while adults say “mindfulness.”
D: Anyone bothering you at school?
P: No. I’m not popular enough to bully. I sit, do the thing, go home.
D: Okay. I want to check in: pain in the center, most days, worse after meals, no red flags like blood, weight loss, or waking at night. That fits with functional abdominal pain—real pain, from a sensitive gut and a jumpy gut-brain wiring. Not in your head. In your nerves.
P: So, the “it’s real but invisible” talk. How do you know it’s not, like, a parasite trying to colonize me?
D: Good question. Your growth is steady, exam last time was normal, no fever, no blood, normal stools. Parasites and ulcers usually leave clues. We can do a small set of labs to be safe—blood count, inflammation markers, and a celiac screen. If those are normal and you keep growing, it supports what I’m saying.
P: Will you actually call me with numbers or just “it’s fine”?
D: I’ll give you the numbers. You can even see the ranges if you want.
P: Good. I like data more than pep talks.
D: Same. For treatment, a few options we can mix and match. You tell me what you’ll actually try.
P: Hit me.
D: One: gut-directed strategies. Slow diaphragmatic breathing when it flares, a heating pad, and staying active—don’t avoid school or skating. Two: peppermint oil capsules—enteric-coated—can calm cramping. Three: a fiber supplement, small daily dose, and steady hydration. Four: a short trial of an antispasmodic medicine for sharp cramps if needed. Five: brain-gut therapies like CBT or gut-directed hypnotherapy—they teach your brain to turn down the volume on pain signals.
P: Hypnosis? Like, you snap your fingers and I cluck? Hard pass.
D: No clucking. It’s guided relaxation with scripts aimed at the gut. Solid evidence in kids. But you don’t have to choose it.
P: If I say yes to peppermint and breathing, do I have to sit in a circle and share my feelings?
D: No circles required. We can also set you up with a one-on-one therapist who’s very practical. You’d learn skills, not spill secrets.
P: I can tolerate skills.
D: Great. Triggers-wise, try regular meals—breakfast included—less greasy stuff, and keep caffeine low. How’s your sleep?
P: Headphones on, out by ten. I’m fine.
D: Good. When a flare hits at school, what would help?
P: Five minutes to breathe without everyone staring. Not the nurse’s bed—makes me feel like I’m five.
D: I’ll write a note: permission to step out for five minutes, use breathing technique, heat pack if available, then back to class. No “send home unless fever or vomiting.”
P: Thank you. I don’t want to miss stuff; I just don’t want to sit there white-knuckling it.
D: We’ll also keep a short log for two weeks—time, what you ate, stress level, pain 0–10. Just to see patterns.
P: Fine. I like charts.
D: Meds: okay to try peppermint oil twice a day? If cramping is bad, we can add a small dose antispasmodic as needed. I’ll talk dosing with your parent, but you’ll be in the loop.
P: As long as nobody calls it “tummy medicine.”
D: Deal. Any worries you want straight answers on?
P: Is this going to be forever?
D: Usually not. Most kids improve over months with the right tools. Flares can happen, but they get shorter and less intense.
P: And if your labs aren’t “boring”?
D: Then we adjust. If anything’s off or you develop red flags—blood in stool, weight loss, high fevers, pain waking you up—we do more tests or bring in a GI specialist.
P: Okay. Can I still skate today?
D: Yes. Warm up, hydrate, don’t go for hero moves right after a heavy meal.
P: Hero moves are kind of my brand. But noted.
D: Last thing: do you want me to explain this to your parents or do you want to do the summary?
P: I’ll do it and you can fact-check. “My gut’s sensitive, not broken. We’re doing labs, peppermint, breathing, fiber, and a pass to take five at school. No one’s babying me.”
D: Nailed it.
P: Cool. If this works, I’ll try not to become insufferable about being right.
D: I can live with that. I’ll see you in four weeks, sooner if you need me.
P: Four weeks. Bring numbers. I’ll bring charts.

gpt-4.1,,"P: Okay, let’s skip the small talk. My legs feel like they’re made of soggy noodles, and I’m tired all the time—even when I do absolutely nothing. So, I need to know if this is just the joy of MS, or if my meds are doing squat now.
D: Thank you for coming in, Monica. I'm sorry to hear things have gotten worse. Can you walk me through when you started noticing the increased weakness and fatigue?
P: Well, I noticed it about three weeks ago. At first, I blamed it on the weather. Or maybe too many late nights. But it just kept getting harder—I pretty much need a nap after making breakfast. And before you ask, yes, I’m still taking my meds exactly as prescribed. I stick to routines like glue.
D: That’s good to hear about adherence. Have you had any other symptoms—changes in vision, bladder issues, balance getting worse, anything like that?
P: Vision’s fine, knock on wood. Balance is...well, it was never winning awards, but it’s not drastically different. Haven’t started falling on my face more than usual, if that’s what you’re getting at. Bladder’s the same: annoying but manageable. This is really about my legs and the fatigue—just walking down to get the mail feels like sabotage.
D: Thank you. Are you finding your mood or sleep patterns changing at all with these symptoms?
P: Sleep is a mess, but when is it not? I wake up loads, mostly because my legs get restless. Mood...look, let’s not pretend I was ever Queen Sunshine, but yes, I’m more irritable. Everything feels heavier. Can’t tell if that’s MS or just being awake to all the garbage in the world.
D: I appreciate your honesty, as always. Let’s talk about your current treatment. You’re still on the disease-modifying therapy we started a year and a half ago, correct?
P: Yep. Oral meds, every morning, no cheats. I set three alarms because, trust me, I don’t want a relapse on top of everything else. Is it possible it just stopped working? Because I don’t exactly feel “modified.”
D: It can happen that therapies lose effectiveness over time or that MS becomes more active. Have you had any infections, new stressors, or anything else that’s changed recently?
P: No infections—thank you, hand sanitizer. Stress? Sure, but that’s just called ‘life’ when you’re staring down bills alone in a pandemic. But it’s not worse than last year. No big changes at home, still don’t let anyone move my stuff around.
D: Understood. I’d like to order new imaging—an MRI—so we can see if there’s new or active lesions. We can also check bloodwork to rule out anything else contributing to your fatigue, like thyroid or vitamin deficiencies. How do you feel about those next steps?
P: I like data, so fine by me. I want facts, not pep talks, so if the MRI says things are going downhill, let’s not sugarcoat it. And don’t even try to blame “mood” for muscle weakness. I know the difference.
D: That’s completely fair, Monica. If it turns out your MS is more active, we can review other treatment options—potentially switching therapies or adding something for symptom management. We’ll do our best to support your independence.
P: Good. That’s all I want—tools, not pity. Can we get this moving quickly? I have things to do besides filling out ten forms and sitting on hold with insurance.
D: Absolutely. I’ll prioritize your orders, and my team will help schedule the MRI within the week. Is there anything else that’s worrying you right now?
P: Just the usual: being able to walk, making rent, not turning into a “case” instead of a person. Oh—and if any sample meds or resources cross your desk for fatigue, you can toss them my way. I’ll try whatever doesn’t cost an arm and a leg.
D: I’ll look for resources that might help. Thank you for being straightforward, Monica. We’ll follow up soon with results and a plan.
P: Thanks, Doc. Don’t sugarcoat it, remember. I’ve seen scarier things than an MRI machine.

gpt-4.1,,"P: Morning, Doctor. Sorry I’m a couple minutes early—traffic through Main Street’s lighter since they closed the north exit. Figured that was as good a reason as any not to dawdle. 
D: Good morning, Robert! No trouble at all. It’s always nice to be ahead of schedule. How have you been since your last visit?
P: Well, I can’t complain too loudly. The tomatoes are coming in better than ever, and I keep telling my wife it must be her singing to 'em. As for me, I’m mostly keeping to my routines. Still out at the bank twice a week, and volunteering, of course. Physically…not much has changed, near as I can tell.
D: Glad to hear you’re keeping active. Any new symptoms or issues since we last talked? Any headaches, dizziness, or swelling in your legs?
P: No headaches, no dizziness. My joints creak like the front porch after a rough winter, but that’s nothing new. My ankles get a little puffy by the end of the day sometimes, but it goes down overnight. Blood pressure at home’s been mostly under 135 over 80, if my wife’s reading is to be trusted. She’s a stickler about it—calls it “farmers’ honesty.”
D: Those numbers are pretty good! Have you noticed your medication causing any problems—cough, fatigue, anything unusual?
P: Well, I’m tired by the time the evening news comes on, but that might just be the nature of being seventy, hm? No cough, no strange aches to speak of. I do find myself getting up once or twice at night for the restroom. That’s probably in the “old age gets us all” category too.
D: That’s not uncommon, but let me make a note. Have you noticed any changes in your appetite or weight?
P: Let’s see… the grandkids say I’m shrinking, but they’re measuring in enthusiasm, not inches. My weight’s steady as far as I can tell. Eating just fine, though I keep to my garden stuff as much as I can—less salt, more radishes, like you recommended.
D: I appreciate you sticking to those suggestions. Are you still taking your blood pressure medication every morning?
P: Like a clock—right after breakfast, every day. I keep the bottle next to the coffeepot so I don’t forget. Figure if I skip the pills, the coffee wouldn’t taste as sweet.
D: Good. You mentioned some trouble with nerves, especially in new situations. Has that gotten any worse?
P: No, nothing new there. Still get fidgety if I’m put on the spot, especially if they ask me to talk about “my legacy” at a luncheon, or some such nonsense. I’m better with a hammer than a microphone. 
D: Thank you for sharing that, Robert. That’s helpful to know. Anything else that’s been on your mind lately, health-wise?
P: To be honest, doctor, it’s the usual nagging worries—don’t want to outlive my usefulness or wake up and realize I’ve spent too much time sitting down. This slowing-down business is for the birds. But I suppose that’s not something you can give me a script for.
D: I hear you, Robert. Aging isn’t easy, but you’re doing a great job keeping active and involved. Let’s check your blood pressure now, and after that, we’ll talk about whether we need to adjust anything.
P: All right then. Roll up my sleeve and let’s see if my numbers can impress you more than my tomatoes.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Hey, Dr. Johnson! Thanks for seeing me today. I’ve been practicing a lot with my team, but sometimes after running around really hard, I start wheezing and coughing. It’s kind of like my chest is trying to tell me something.
D: Hi, Ethan! It’s good to see you again. I hear you’ve been having some trouble after playing soccer. Can you tell me more about when the wheezing and coughing happen?
P: Yeah, mostly after I’ve been sprinting or kicking the ball super fast. Like, I’ll be chasing my friends and suddenly I just feel like I can't get enough air, and then I start coughing a lot. It’s kind of like my lungs are throwing a mini tantrum.
D: That sounds uncomfortable. Have you noticed if these episodes happen more on certain days or after specific activities?
P: Hmm, well, it’s worse on really windy days, I think. And if I forget to bring my inhaler, it gets even more stubborn. One time, I almost had to sit out during a game because I couldn’t breathe right.
D: I see. And have you experienced any other symptoms, like tightness in your chest or feeling tired even after resting?
P: Yeah, sometimes my chest feels tight, kinda like I have a really tight sport’s band around it. And I get super tired pretty fast, even if I haven’t done anything crazy, like racing my sister in the backyard.
D: That’s important to know. Ethan, have you been using your inhaler regularly? Or just when you feel like this happens?
P: I only use it when I start wheezing or coughing too much. Sometimes I forget, but I know I should probably use it more often, especially before I play soccer.
D: That’s good awareness. I think we should check your lung function today, just to make sure everything is okay. And I want to review your inhaler technique with you to see if we can make it more effective.
P: Cool! I’ve always wanted to know if I’m doing it right. I want to keep playing soccer and finishing my Lego projects without problems.
D: Absolutely. Also, I’ll give you some tips about what to do when you’re feeling wheezy and how to prevent future episodes. We want to keep those mini tantrums at bay so you can enjoy your adventures.
P: Thanks, Dr. Johnson! I really want to be the fastest on my team—and the best at making sure everyone’s having fun too.

gpt-4.1-nano,,"P: Hi Doc, so, the thing is, I’ve been dancing my heart out, right? And sometimes, I start breathing kinda like I just finished running a mile, even if I didn’t. It's a weird, sneaky cough too, like a little monster trying to come out. 
D: I see. Eli, you’ve been noticing these short breath periods and coughs during or after dancing? How often does it happen? 
P: Oh, uh, I’d say maybe after about half of my practice sessions. And sometimes, at school, during recess, I get that tickle in my chest again. It’s kinda annoying, but I wanna keep moving—it’s like music in my body! 
D: It’s great you’re so active and love dancing. But these symptoms suggest your asthma might need some more attention. Do you feel okay when you’re resting? 
P: Yeah, totally fine. Like, I can sit on the couch and watch TV all day, no problem. It’s only when I’m jumping around like a crazy person. 
D: Good to know, Eli. When these episodes happen, do they come suddenly, or do they build up over time? 
P: Sometimes, I can feel it coming—like my chest gets a little tight, and my heart starts racing. That’s when I want to stop, but I keep going ‘cause I’m a dancer! 
D: Alright. Do you ever use your inhaler when this happens? 
P: Not really. I mean, I have one, but I forget sometimes, or I don’t want to bug my parents to give it to me. 
D: Well, Eli, it’s important to have your inhaler ready, just like a superhero’s gadget. It can help stop these episodes from getting worse. I’d like to check your lungs now, okay? 
P: Okay, but can I ask—what if I sound like a burping dragon again? 
D: That sounds fun, but I’ll do my best to listen carefully. Let’s see how your lungs are doing today.

gpt-5,low,"P: Hi Dr. Nguyen! I brought my inhaler and my lucky soccer socks. They don’t help breathing, but they help goals.
D: Hi Ethan, great to see you. Nice socks. How have your lungs been during soccer lately?
P: Kinda squeaky. Like a rubber duck stuck in my chest after I sprint a lot. I cough too, especially in the second half.
D: How often has that been happening?
P: Um… three times last week. And once I coughed a bunch at night, like after we practiced corners.
D: Any times you had to stop playing or sit out because of it?
P: Yeah, Coach told me to take a knee and sip water. I didn’t wanna, but I felt tight. I didn’t cry though. I just did tiny breaths.
D: Are you using your rescue inhaler before or after soccer?
P: I do two puffs after I start wheezing. Sometimes I forget it’s in my bag until Mom reminds me.
D: And your daily controller inhaler—are you taking it morning and evening?
P: Morning, yeah. Evening… sometimes I’m building a LEGO dragon and then it’s bedtime and I forget. Don’t tell my mom. Actually, she probably knows.
D: Thanks for being honest. Any coughing at night besides that one time?
P: Maybe twice this month. Not the super-bad kind, just annoying “ahem ahem.”
D: Any colds lately or allergies—itchy eyes, sneezing, stuffy nose?
P: My eyes get itchy when the yellow dust is on Dad’s car. Pollen. And running in cold air makes my chest feel like a freezer.
D: Got it. Any emergency visits or needing a nebulizer?
P: No ER. I did the neb once at home when I had a cold, and I watched a superhero movie while I did it.
D: When you use the inhaler, can you show me your technique?
P: Okay—shake-shake, put it on the spacer, big breath, pssht, then I breathe in slow, hold like ten, maybe nine, then I kinda burp.
D: That’s pretty good. One tip: breathe out first, then pssht as you start a slow breath in, hold for ten, and wait about 30 seconds between puffs. Sound doable?
P: I can do that. I’ll count in my head like “one Mississippi” but faster.
D: During games, try two puffs of your rescue inhaler 15 minutes before warm-ups. That helps prevent the wheeze.
P: So… I can still play? I really wanna play. I’m wing today.
D: Absolutely. With pre-treatment, a good warm-up, and your controller every day, you should be fine. If you start to feel tight, take a break and use your inhaler.
P: Okay. I don’t wanna be the kid who sits out. I like passing to my friend Mateo.
D: You’re a good teammate. We’ll also bump up your controller dose a bit to keep things calm. And rinse your mouth after each use, alright?
P: Rinse, swish, spit. Got it. Like a dragon who doesn’t get thrush.
D: We’ll do a quick breathing test now. Big blow into the tube like you’re blowing out a giant birthday cake.
P: How many candles? A hundred? I’m ten, but I can blast a hundred.
D: Give it your best superhero blow.
P: Ffffffff—whoa, my cheeks feel like balloons.
D: Nice effort. Your numbers are a little lower than your last visit, which matches what you’re feeling. Another reason to adjust your controller.
P: Will the new plan make me faster? I wanna keep up with Liam—he’s like lightning.
D: It should help you breathe easier so you can run your best. Also, start with a slow jog and some stretches before sprints.
P: Warm-up. No turbo right away. Copy.
D: Any pets or smoke around you?
P: No smoke. We have a dog named Biscuit. He’s chill. He doesn’t make me sneeze, but grass does sometimes.
D: On high-pollen days, use your pre-treatment, consider an over-the-counter antihistamine in the morning, and shower after practice to rinse the pollen off.
P: So I can be Pollen Man… but less sneezy.
D: Exactly. I’ll also give you an asthma action plan for school and your coach—green, yellow, red zones with what to do.
P: Can I draw a comic on it? Like “Ethan vs. The Wheeze”?
D: As long as you can still read the instructions, I love that idea.
P: Deal.
D: Signs to get help fast: if you’re breathing so hard you can’t speak full sentences, your lips look bluish, your ribs pull in, or the inhaler isn’t helping after the prescribed doses—tell an adult and seek urgent care.
P: That sounds scary, but I’ll remember. Blue lips = bad.
D: We’ll check back in 6–8 weeks, or sooner if things don’t improve. Flu shot this season?
P: Not yet. Do I have to?
D: It’s recommended. It helps prevent flu from triggering your asthma.
P: Okay. I’ll be brave if I get a sticker. Maybe a soccer ball one.
D: I think we can arrange that. Any other questions?
P: Um… if I forget my evening dose, should I take double in the morning?
D: No doubling. Just take the next scheduled dose and try setting a reminder—maybe an alarm or a note by your LEGO station.
P: I’ll tape a note to the dragon’s face. He’ll remind me.
D: Perfect. You’re all set. Pre-treat before soccer, daily controller with good technique, manage pollen, and we’ll see you soon.
P: Thanks, Dr. Nguyen. I’m gonna score one for Team Lungs.

D: Sorry to hear that, Jayden. Can you tell me more about what happens when your chest hurts?
P: I dunno... I get all wheezy and stuff. Can I get a sticker now?
D: Not just yet, little buddy. But soon. Mr. and Mrs. Williams, what have you observed at home? Any changes in Jayden's symptoms or behavior?
P: Actually, yes. The coughing at night has gotten worse. Sometimes it takes us an hour to get him to settle down. And during the day, he gets winded faster. We're worried that his current medication isn't working well enough.
D: I see. Let's take a look. We may need to adjust his inhaler dosage or add another medication. Have you noticed any triggers for his asthma attacks?
P: Oh, yes. He had a big episode during a playdate last week. All the kids were playing outside, and there was a lot of dust blowing around.
D: I'll make a note of that. You like playing outside with your friends, huh?

gpt-4.1-mini,,"P: Good afternoon, doctor. Thanks for seeing me on short notice. I’ve been dealing with these migraines for a while now, but lately, they’ve started cutting into my work, and, honestly, my patience.
D: I’m glad you came in, Marcus. Can you describe the migraines? When did they start, and what are they like?
P: They kicked off maybe two years ago, off and on at first—like low-level noise in the background. But over the last six months? It’s been more frequent and intense. Usually behind my eyes or temples, throbbing, sometimes with sensitivity to light or sound. It’s like my brain’s running a relentless chess match I can’t win.
D: That does sound tough, especially with your work demanding sharp concentration. Do you notice any triggers or patterns?
P: Triggers vary. Stress is a prime offender—deadlines, long hours staring at screens. Sometimes, if I skip meals or sleep gets irregular. I’ve tried to keep a headache journal, but it’s hard to pin down a single cause. It feels like the migraines have their own agenda.
D: That’s a good start, though, tracking them. Do you have any nausea, visual disturbances, or aura symptoms before the headaches?
P: Occasionally, I’ll get some visual flickers—like shimmering in the corners of my vision. No nausea usually, which is fortunate. Thankfully, no vomiting either. Mostly, it’s that pulsating pain and then a kind of mental fog that follows.
D: Have you tried any treatments or medications so far?
P: Over-the-counter pain meds here and there, ibuprofen or acetaminophen, but they’re hit or miss. I’m cautious about leaning on meds too much—kind of like relying on a crutch when I want to keep walking on my own, if that makes sense.
D: It does. Managing migraines can be a balancing act between medication and lifestyle changes. How has this been affecting your daily life and work?
P: It’s frustrating. At work, I analyze complex data sets and try to see the bigger picture—when a migraine hits, it’s like someone shuffles the deck and takes out the aces. I hate feeling less capable. Outside work, it cuts into those rare moments I get to lose myself in a book or a quiet game of chess. Makes me wonder if I need to rethink the pace I keep.
D: That’s an important insight. We can work on a treatment plan that fits your lifestyle and hopefully eases those symptoms. Would you be open to preventive medications, or are you more interested in non-pharmacological approaches first?
P: I’m open to anything that genuinely helps. Preventive meds sound serious, and I want to understand the pros and cons. I’m all for lifestyle tweaks—better sleep hygiene, hydration, maybe some mindfulness or exercise—but if there’s something that can keep the migraines at bay without heavy side effects, I’m willing to try it.
D: That’s a balanced approach. I’ll suggest a medication that’s well-tolerated and effective for many migraine sufferers. We’ll start low and monitor. Also, I can refer you to a neurologist specialized in headaches, and a headache clinic if you’re interested.
P: A referral sounds helpful. Sometimes I’m quick to try to handle things solo, but it’s clear I might need a network here. Also, if there’s any material or support groups you recommend, I’d appreciate that too.
D: Absolutely, I’ll provide some resources. We’ll schedule a follow-up in four weeks to see how you’re doing. In the meantime, let’s work on a headache diary with specifics about triggers, duration, and intensity.
P: Thanks, doctor. Taking action on this feels like finally investing in myself—something I’m not as good at as I’d like. I appreciate your understanding.
D: You’re very welcome, Marcus. Prioritizing your health is essential, especially with the goals and passions you have. We’ll work through this together.

D: Hi there! Hi, Malachi. I’m Dr. Harris. I like your dinosaur. What’s his name?
P: Malachi: Thunderfoot. He’s brave. He stomps the bad guys out of Tummy Town.
D: Excellent helper. Can Thunderfoot show me where your tummy hurts?
P: Malachi: Here. Right here by my belly button. It feels squinchy.
D: Thanks, buddy. Mom, tell me what’s been going on.
P: Mom: For a few weeks he’s had stomach aches, mostly in the mornings before daycare or when something changes in our routine. Sometimes he gets red and clingy.
D: How long does each tummy ache last?
P: Mom: Ten to twenty minutes, sometimes a little longer. It often eases after drop-off or if we slow down.
D: Any fever, vomiting, diarrhea, or blood in his stool?
P: Mom: No fever. No vomiting, no blood. He goes once a day most days.
D: Are his poops hard or painful? Any straining?
P: Mom: Sometimes they’re little pebbles, especially on daycare days. He’ll hold it there. At home they’re softer.
D: Any weight loss, night-time pain that wakes him up, or pain that’s always in one spot like the lower right side?
P: Mom: No weight loss. He sleeps through the night. Pain is around the belly button, not just one side.
D: Any pain when he pees?
P: Mom: No.
D: How’s his appetite and energy?
P: Mom: Pretty good once he settles. He’s lively. He’ll slow down in the morning when his tummy hurts.
D: Any recent changes—new classroom, teachers, schedule?
P: Mom: New room at daycare and a new drop-off routine. He’s shy, so transitions are hard. We keep routines and we pray together, but he still gets nervous.
P: Malachi: The door goes click and my tummy twists like a knot snake.
D: That’s a good description. Any foods that seem to set it off—lots of milk, juice, or greasy foods?
P: Mom: He loves cheese. Juice is limited. Sometimes he gets gassy with mac and cheese.
D: Anyone in the family with celiac, Crohn’s, or ulcerative colitis?
P: Mom: No.
D: Okay. Malachi, can I check your tummy with my warm hands? Thunderfoot can stand guard.
P: Malachi: Okay. He’s on duty.
D: Great. I’m listening to your heart and lungs—sounds healthy. Now I’m pressing gently… your belly is soft, no bumps, no sore spots when I press. Bowel sounds are normal.
P: Malachi: That tickles.
D: You did awesome. Growth chart looks on track, too.
P: Mom: That’s a relief.
D: From what I’m hearing and seeing—belly pain around changes, normal exam, no red flags—this sounds like functional abdominal pain. The belly and the brain have a busy phone line. When feelings get big, the belly can squeeze even when it’s healthy. Mild constipation and holding poop can add to that squeeze.
P: Malachi: Is there a belly phone?
D: Yep—an invisible walkie-talkie. We can teach it to use quiet voices.
P: Mom: We’re listening.
D: Here’s the plan. First, keep the belly comfortable: regular meals and water, fruits like pears/berries, veggies, and whole grains. Limit juice. Let’s have him sit on the toilet after breakfast and dinner for a few calm minutes—feet on a stool, no pressure, just a routine. If pebbly stools continue, we can add a gentle stool softener; I’ll message dosing after we track a week.
P: Mom: We can do that.
D: Second, calm the belly-brain line. Malachi, try “dino belly breaths”: smell the forest through your nose, blow out birthday candles through your mouth. Hands on your tummy, make it rise like a Triceratops. Five slow breaths when your tummy gets squinchy.
P: Malachi: Rawr-breaths. I can do five. Maybe six.
D: Perfect. You can also rub gentle circles on your belly or use a warm pack for a few minutes.
P: Mom: He likes warm packs. We have one at home.
D: Third, make drop-offs predictable. A little visual schedule, a short goodbye routine—hug, prayer, two dino breaths, then hand-off. A small comfort item in his backpack and a sticker chart for “brave belly breaths.” Keep him in his normal activities; staying home can make the belly phone ring louder next time.
P: Mom: That all fits us. We already pray in the morning—we’ll fold it into the routine.
P: Malachi: Can I name the tummy twist? Maybe Worry-Raptor.
D: I love Worry-Raptor. When he shows up, you tell him, “I’ve got this,” and do your dino breaths.
P: Mom: He’ll love that.
D: I’ll also give you a simple pain-and-poop tracker. Note when it hurts, what was happening, and stool type. We’ll review in 4 weeks. If things worsen or you see red flags—blood in stool, persistent vomiting, fevers, weight loss, waking at night with pain, or sharp one-sided belly pain—call me sooner.
P: Mom: Thank you for the clear guidance.
P: Malachi: If I get a sticker, can Thunderfoot get one too?
D: Absolutely. Thunderfoot gets extra for guard duty. You both did great today.
P: Mom: Thanks, Dr. Harris.
D: You’re welcome. We’ve got a good plan. See you soon.

D: Do you notice an aura—flashing lights, zigzag lines, numbness, or trouble speaking?
P: Sometimes about twenty minutes before: shimmering edges in my vision, like heat waves on asphalt. No numbness or word salad, thankfully.
D: Any triggers you’ve picked up on?
P: Skipped meals, too little sleep, long stretches of screen time, and strong colognes. Red wine is a bully. Weather swings do me dirty too.
D: What helps when they start?
P: Ibuprofen if I catch it early. Dark room, cold pack. Caffeine sometimes, but that’s a gamble. I try not to pop pills too often.
D: Any over-the-counter use more than two or three days a week?
P: Nah. I keep it under that—part frugal, part cautious.
D: Any current medications or supplements?
P: Just a multivitamin I forget half the time. No prescriptions.
D: Medical history? Surgeries? Allergies?
P: Pretty boring chart. No surgeries, no allergies that I know of.
D: Family history of migraines?
P: My mom called them “spells” growing up. Sounds like the same beast.
D: How’s sleep?
P: Erratic. I’ll grind on a report until 1 a.m., then be up at 6:30. Weekends I crash hard.
D: Caffeine and hydration?
P: One coffee in the morning, maybe a second if I’m on a deadline. Water… let’s say I’m trying to be better.
D: Alcohol or substances?
P: Occasional beer. Red wine on rare nights, but I usually regret it. No smoking, nothing else.
D: Stress level?
P: High but “functional.” I love the work, but I carry it home. Chicago buses get a lot of my rumination.
D: Any recent head injuries, weakness, fever, weight loss, or a “worst-ever” headache?
P: No injuries, no scary stuff. Just the recurring migraine story.
D: Any vision changes outside the aura? Eye strain issues?
P: Lots of screen time. I probably need an updated prescription; my glasses are from grad school days. Thrifted frames, great price, questionable optics.
D: Got it. Based on what you’ve told me, this sounds like migraine with visual aura, increasing in frequency. We can work on both quick relief and prevention. How open are you to medication options?
P: Open, as long as I’m not signing up for something pricier than my rent.
D: For acute attacks, a triptan—like sumatriptan—can stop a migraine if taken early. Newer options called gepants, like ubrogepant, also work and can be easier on some people. We’d limit use to avoid rebound headaches.
P: If I take it at the shimmer stage, that’s ideal?
D: Exactly—at the first sign. We can also pair with an anti-nausea medicine if needed.
P: And for prevention?
D: Since you’re at 4–6 per month and it’s affecting work, a preventive makes sense. Options include:
- Beta-blockers like propranolol.
- Topiramate.
- Amitriptyline at low dose at night.
- Newer CGRP inhibitors—very effective, but often pricier.
P: My budget likes the first three. Any side effects I should know?
D: Propranolol can lower heart rate and cause fatigue. Topiramate may cause tingling, word-finding issues, or weight loss. Amitriptyline can make you drowsy and cause dry mouth but helps sleep.
P: I wouldn’t mind better sleep. I do need clear words for work, so topiramate’s word-finding thing makes me nervous.
D: Fair point. We could start with low-dose amitriptyline at night. If it’s not a match, we can pivot to propranolol.
P: Sounds reasonable.
D: Non-medical supports: regular sleep schedule, consistent meals with protein, more hydration, timed breaks from screens, and exercise 3–4 times a week. Magnesium glycinate 400 mg nightly and riboflavin 400 mg daily can reduce frequency for some folks. Affordable options.
P: I can handle magnesium and a bedtime like a grown-up. I’ll try.
D: Also consider a headache diary—note sleep, food, screens, stress, weather, and timing. Patterns help refine treatment.
P: Data is my love language. I’ll make a spreadsheet I probably shouldn’t be proud of.
D: Perfect. Regarding imaging: you don’t have red flags, your exam today is normal, and you have a typical history, so no scan is needed right now. If anything changes—worst-ever headache, new neurologic symptoms, headaches that wake you from sleep—call immediately.
P: Understood.
D: Work accommodations might help—adjusted lighting, scheduled screen breaks, maybe a monitor filter. Do you want a note?
P: That would help. Our office fluorescents are… aggressive.
D: I’ll write one. For today, I propose:
- Start amitriptyline 10 mg nightly for a week, then 20 mg if tolerated.
- Sumatriptan 50 mg at onset; may repeat once in 2 hours if needed, max 2 doses per attack, not more than 9 doses/month.
- Magnesium glycinate 400 mg nightly; riboflavin 400 mg daily.
- Headache diary, sleep routine, hydration goal of 2 liters/day.
P: Clear. Any issues with taking sumatriptan with coffee?
D: That’s fine. Just keep total caffeine moderate.
P: Cool. If the amitriptyline turns me into a zombie?
D: Message me. We’d lower the dose or switch to propranolol. Also, dry mouth is common—sugar-free gum helps.
P: Got it.
D: Do you want an anti-nausea medication on hand?
P: Probably smart. The queasy days are rough.
D: I’ll add ondansetron 4 mg, take as needed. Try to take fluids even when nauseated.
P: Thanks.
D: Any financial concerns with these meds? We can choose generics and I’ll send to a low-cost pharmacy.
P: Generics are my love language, too.
D: Great. I’ll send prescriptions and the workplace note. Let’s follow up in six weeks to assess frequency and side effects. Reach out sooner if anything worsens.
P: Appreciate it. This feels like an actual plan, not just me bargaining with ibuprofen.
D: You’re doing the right thing. Anything else on your mind?
P: Just hoping that mentoring the next generation doesn’t require mentoring my headaches. But we’ll start here.
D: Fair enough. We’ll work to get you there with fewer interruptions.
P: Thanks, Dr. Patel. I’ll start the plan and report back—with charts.

gpt-5,medium,"P: Hi, Doctor! Look, I got my red car. Vroom vroom!
D: Hi, Jayden! I love that red car. Can I sit right here with you and talk for a minute?
P: Uh-huh. You got a blue shirt like Chase. Paw Patrol!
D: You noticed! How’ve you been breathing, buddy? Any coughs or wheezes?
P: My chest goes squeak-squeak at night. Like a little puppy. I cough lots.
D: Lots at night—how many nights this week, do you think?
P: Mama says… almost every night. I slept on her arm. I cried.
D: I’m sorry that was hard. Do you get out of breath when you run or play cars?
P: When I run fast outside, my tummy feels tight and I stop. I go “I need my puffer!”
D: Good job knowing when you need it. Which inhaler do you use when you’re tight, the blue one?
P: Blue one! With my green space helmet. Two puffs. Daddy counts.
D: Do you ever use an orange inhaler every day?
P: Morning time, Mama says, “Open big.” One puff. Tastes yucky. I get water.
D: Okay—one orange puff in the morning. Do you ever take the orange at night too?
P: Not at night. Only sun time.
D: How many times did you need the blue inhaler this week?
P: Um… three at church ‘cause we were dancing! And two at the park. And one when I went “achoo” at Auntie’s cat.
D: Cats make you sneeze?
P: Kitty makes my nose tickle and my chest sings. Squeak song.
D: Any smoke or strong smells at home?
P: Mama says we blow out candles. No smoky. Grandma’s scarf smells pretty, but I say “it’s spicy.”
D: Got it. Any fevers or trips to the emergency room?
P: No hospital. I got a big hug and my nebulizer fog. Like a cloud.
D: You use a nebulizer sometimes too?
P: Yes! It’s like a train. Choo-choo.
D: Can you show me how you use your puffer with the spacer?
P: I shake it. Tap tap. I put the mask. I go puff. I breathe like this—big dragon.
D: That’s excellent. After the orange one, do you rinse or brush?
P: I swish water. Then I make bubbles. Hee hee.
D: Perfect. I’m going to listen to your lungs now. Big deep breaths, like smelling flowers and blowing out birthday candles.
P: Smell the flowers… blow the candles… Your thing is cold!
D: Almost done. I hear a little wheeze. Not scary, but I want you breathing easier.
P: I want to run fast. Like Zuma. Splash!
D: We’re going to help you do that. I think we should make a small change: take the orange inhaler two times a day—morning and night—every day.
P: Two times? Night time too?
D: Yes, morning and night. After both, rinse your mouth. That medicine keeps the squeaks away.
P: Okay. I can do big boy rinse.
D: And keep using the blue inhaler if you’re tight or before you run hard—two puffs with your green mask.
P: Before zoom zoom play?
D: Exactly—five to fifteen minutes before big play or church dancing.
P: Yay dancing!
D: If your cough wakes you more than two nights in a row, or the blue puffer isn’t helping after 20 minutes, tell Mom and Dad to call me, okay?
P: I’ll tell. I say, “Call Doctor!”
D: We’ll also give you an asthma action plan with colors—green, yellow, red—so everyone knows what to do.
P: Green like my spacer! Red like my car!
D: You got it. Do you sleep with lots of stuffed animals?
P: Five. No—six. My lion, my bear, my truck pillow.
D: Let’s keep just a couple in bed and wash them and your sheets in hot water each week. It helps your breathing.
P: Lion can stay. The others can sit on the chair.
D: And when you visit Auntie’s cat, try to use your blue inhaler before you go, and wash hands and face after.
P: I’ll say, “Hi kitty, no kisses.”
D: Deal. Do you have any ouchies in your mouth or a hoarse voice from the orange inhaler?
P: No ouchies. My voice goes “ROAR!” See? ROAR!
D: Very strong roar. Do you want a sticker after we’re done?
P: Paw Patrol sticker? Chase. Or Zuma. Or both.
D: We’ll see what we can do. One more question: are you okay with a flu shot today? It helps keep your lungs happy.
P: A poke? I don’t like pokes. Mama holds my hand?
D: Mama can hold your hand, and you can squeeze my other hand. Quick like a blink, then sticker time.
P: Okay… but I get a lollipop?
D: We have a special sticker and a high-five. How about that?
P: High-five big!
D: High-five. We’ll also schedule a check-in in about four weeks to see how the night cough is doing. If you’re still coughing a lot, we’ll adjust more.
P: Four sleeps?
D: More like many sleeps—about a month. Your parents will mark the calendar.
P: We pray at night. I can pray for no cough.
D: I love that plan. We’ll do our part with the medicines, and you keep doing those big dragon breaths.
P: Rawr-breathe. Like this! Hooo… pfffff.
D: Perfect technique. Any questions for me, Jayden?
P: Can I still run fast in the park?
D: Yes. With your plan and your puffs, you can run, play, and dance.
P: Yay! I’m zooming.
D: Great. I’m printing your action plan, updating your orange inhaler to morning and night, and we’ll show Mom and Dad the spacer technique again.
P: I’ll show them. I’m the captain.
D: Captain Jayden, you’re all set. Ready for that quick poke and stickers?
P: Ready. I’m brave. Then vroom vroom!

gpt-5-mini,medium,"P: Morning, doctor. Sorry to keep you—didn't want to make a fuss, but I've been feeling lightheaded off and on. Figured I better come in.
D: Good morning, Mr. Bradley. You're not making a fuss. Tell me more—when did the dizziness start, and how often is it happening?
P: Been about a month, a little more often the last two weeks. Mostly when I get up from my chair in the sunroom after playing a tune or when I stand up quick from the bed. No full fainting, just a sort of woozy, like the room's a little loose. Scared me once when I nearly missed a step to the kitchen.
D: Any chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations, recent falls, or changes in vision?
P: No chest pain. Heart thumps now and then when I worry—Margaret says I worry too much—but nothing like it skipped or raced. No trouble seeing. No falls yet. I do feel worn out some mornings.
D: What medications are you taking for your blood pressure?
P: Lisinopril 20 milligrams every morning, and a little water pill—hydrochlorothiazide, 25—and I take my multivitamin. Been taking them same as always. Don't miss them unless I'm out of town to my sister's.
D: Have you taken your blood pressure at home? Any numbers?
P: Yes, I keep a cuff on the kitchen table—used it since the county clerk's office made me keep records of everything. Usually it's been around 150 over 90 in the mornings. Yesterday it read 158 over 94 and I got worried.
D: Any changes in salt intake, weight, fluid loss, diarrhea, or new medications—like over-the-counter cold pills or herbal supplements?
P: Well, between church potlucks and them holiday casseroles I do eat plenty of salt sometimes. Ain't been sick with any stomach bug. No new pills—just what I said. I do take a little nighttime sleep aid from time to time—an old doctor's sample, 5 milligrams of diphenhydramine—but not every night.
D: Okay. I'm going to check your blood pressure and pulse lying and standing now, while we talk. Tell me if you feel lightheaded when you stand.
P: All right.
D: Lying blood pressure 148/86, pulse 78. Standing at one minute it's 116/64, pulse 92. You felt a bit lightheaded when you stood?
P: Yes, sir. That drop felt about like what I described.
D: That's a significant drop in systolic pressure when you stand—orthostatic hypotension—which explains the dizziness. In older adults, that can be from medications, especially diuretics, or from dehydration, or other causes. Given your readings and symptoms, we should make a few changes and run some tests.
P: I figured the water pill might be at fault. Been thinking the same. I don't want to mess with my blood pressure, though—it's been stubborn.
D: I understand. Here's what I suggest: we'll stop the hydrochlorothiazide for now and continue the lisinopril. I'll order blood tests—basic metabolic panel to check kidney function and potassium—because when we change meds we want to be safe. We'll also get an EKG in the office just to check your heart rhythm. I'll ask you to monitor your blood pressure at home twice daily—morning and evening—and keep a log.
P: Stop it outright? That simple?
D: For now, yes, and we'll reassess after the bloodwork and a few days of home measurements. If your blood pressure stays high without the diuretic, we can switch to a different class—like a calcium channel blocker or an ARB—one that tends to cause less orthostatic drop in some folks. We may make small dose adjustments rather than big changes. I want to avoid a fall.
P: I appreciate that. I don't like the idea of falling—Margaret would about have the house turned upside down. She's got a way of fretting worse than I do.
D: We'll protect you. In the meantime, a few practical tips: get up slowly from sitting or lying, sit at the edge of the bed for a moment before standing, drink adequate fluids unless the blood tests tell us otherwise, and avoid heavy alcohol. Also avoid taking both your blood pressure medicine and the diphenhydramine at the same time if it makes you drowsy—some of those over-the-counter sleep aids can worsen dizziness.
P: I'll do that. I can handle slow standing—been slow most my life anyway. About salt—I've heard both ways. Church potlucks are hard to avoid.
D: I know. Try to reduce extra salt where you can—fewer salted meats, less seasoning—small changes help. But first priorities are stopping the diuretic and checking labs. If your morning pressures are still high, we'll start a different agent that your body tolerates better.
P: How soon will the blood work show up? I get anxious sitting here not knowing if I'm about to topple over.
D: We'll draw the blood today; results usually come back within a day or two. I'll have the nurse schedule an EKG now. For the log, bring it back or message it in. If you get faint, pass out, severe chest pain, or shortness of breath—come to the ER.
P: I hear you. If I start seeing stars or drop like a sack, I won't wait. Thank you. You're not prone to using fancy talk—good. Makes a man feel better.
D: You're welcome. Anything else worrying you? Your sleep, appetite, mood—more anxiety than usual?
P: My mind picks at things. The news, the changes in town, Margaret's cough now and then—keeps me up. I pray and I play my guitar in the sunroom—cardinals keep me company most mornings. That helps. But the worrying gets loud sometimes.
D: That's understandable. Prayer and music are great coping tools. If the anxiety feels like it's interfering with daily life, we can discuss techniques or refer you to a counselor. It doesn't have to be a big step—just a conversation.
P: Maybe later. For now, get that water pill stopped and the tests done. I can play a hymn while I wait.
D: Good plan. We'll stop the hydrochlorothiazide today. You'll keep taking lisinopril this morning. I'll order the BMP and EKG, and have the nurse give you instructions on the blood pressure log. Let's check back in 3–5 days when we have the labs and the home readings.
P: Thank you, Doctor. I feel lighter already—figured I'd get fussed at for not watching my salt. I appreciate you being practical.
D: You're doing the right thing by coming in. We'll get this sorted so you can keep playing those tunes and keeping an eye out for cardinals. I'll see you in a few days or sooner if things change.
P: All right. I'll see you then. And thank the nurse—she's got the same steady hands as me, used to signing county papers.
D: Will do. Take care, Mr. Bradley.

gpt-5-nano,medium,"P: Good morning, Doctor. Ellen Kovacs here. I’ll cut to the chase: my knee pain has been worsening and it’s starting to slow me down with cooking and on my weekly walks.
D: Good to see you, Ellen. On a 0-to-10 scale today, where would you put the pain?
P: About a 6, sometimes a 7 after I’ve been on my feet in the kitchen. Mornings are stiff, and I used to knead dough for 20 minutes straight; now five minutes feels like a marathon.
D: Any swelling, warmth, or locking?
P: Not really swelling, but there’s stiffness and occasional grinding when I bend. No warmth. I can still walk, though it’s slower at the arboretum.
D: Have you had recent imaging or changes to medications?
P: I had an X-ray about a year ago. I take acetaminophen daily, and I’ll pop an NSAID if the pain spikes, but they bother my stomach. I’ve used topical diclofenac a few times. I’d prefer avoiding heavy meds around cooking if possible.
D: We can start with nonpharmacologic options—PT focused on leg strength, low-impact activity, heat/cold therapy—and we can add topical NSAID or a short oral NSAID with GI protection if needed. Do you want to try that route first?
P: Yes. I’m all for structure and I’d like to keep cooking and walking if we can. I’d rather avoid surgery if there’s a workable plan.
D: Great. We’ll arrange physical therapy, discuss a knee brace for long days, and consider a corticosteroid injection if the pain remains high after a few weeks. We’ll also review options if injections aren’t preferable.
P: A knee injection would be new to me, but I’m open if it helps get back to kneading dough without wincing.
D: Injections usually don’t interfere with daily tasks, but we’ll time it to avoid your peak kitchen prep periods. We’ll start with a short-term plan and reassess in 6 weeks.
P: I’ll keep a Pain-and-Prep log on my kitchen whiteboard—recipes, tweaks, and pain notes. Privacy matters, but I value a clear plan and direct communication.
D: I’ll send you the written plan, and I’ll coordinate PT and any imaging. If anything changes or you notice red flags, contact us sooner.
P: Thank you. I’ll talk with my husband this evening and we’ll map out the week around the therapy sessions.

D: Spicy smells can tickle your lungs. We’ll talk about cooking with the fan on. Do you have any pets?

D: Dogs can be tricky. Do you feel more wheezy after visits with your cousin?
P: I get sniffles. And my chest makes the tiny whistle.

D: Applesauce is a smart fix. Have you missed any days?

P: Blue before zoom. Got it. Can I get a sticker now?
D: You earned two. Marshall and a gold star. One more question—does anything make it better besides the puffer and hugs?
P: Prayers with Mommy. And my blankie. And sitting by the window. I watch birds.

P: He's been a little under the weather lately with all his coughing fits at night. It’s tough on him—and us too.
D: I understand that, Mrs. Williams. Let’s take a closer look to see what we can do to help Jayden feel better.
P: Every night now, he wakes up wheezing and has trouble breathing while playing outside or with his toys. We’re worried this summer will be hard on him if it stays like this.
D: Did you notice any triggers for these episodes? Is there anything different at home right now?
P: Well, Jayden’s room is usually full of bright colors because he loves everything colorful and happy. But since the weather changed, we’ve noticed more dust in his bedroom.
D: We’ll want to look into that closely during our assessment today. So besides those night coughs, how has he been otherwise? Any fever or other symptoms?
P: He’s still as cheerful and curious as ever! Just really tired after a bad night of coughing. It makes me sad seeing him miss out on playing with his toy cars.
D: I see. Well, let's make today about finding solutions for Jayden to be able to play, laugh and grow without these interruptions. Let’s have a look at him now, okay?
P: Oh, he loves this part! Can we ask Dr. Lee some questions too while she looks at him?
D: Of course! We’re here to help answer all your questions.
P: And can you recommend any things we should look out for during prayer time with him? I want to make sure everything’s okay so it feels good and safe for his health.
D: Your concern is very important, Mrs. Williams. Together, we’ll figure all of that out today. Let's start by listening to Jayden's breathing, shall we?
P: Sounds great! Jayden, could you show Dr. Lee your favorite Paw Patrol badge?
D: Of course! It’s so cool!


D: Well done, Jayden! How about playing for a moment here? Did those games help you today?
P: Yes, it was really nice. Thanks so much.
D: We’ll update Jayden’s medication if needed and monitor his progress closely from here on out. It may also be helpful to run some tests to identify dust allergens in his room. Have you seen someone about that yet?
P: No, hadn’t thought of it specifically. Might this help with all his night coughs?
D: We believe it will give us a clearer picture and might even ease your family’s heart as well.
P: That sounds like such a relief...

D: Hi Terrence, of course. Glad you came in. How have the migraines been since your last visit?

D: Three times a week is a significant increase. Is the pain still as severe as before, or has that changed too?
P: Definitely worse. The last one, I had to cancel a meeting with my lab group. I try to power through usually, but it feels like my head’s trying to shut the rest of me down. Lights and noise in my apartment just make it worse. At this point, I have to hole up in my bedroom with an ice pack and zero distractions.
D: That sounds very disruptive. Any new symptoms with these migraines? Nausea, vision changes, weakness?
P: Yeah, more often I get the aura beforehand—I see these weird flickers, like heat waves at the edge of my vision. Nausea comes and goes. No vomiting, but I feel queasy enough that I just lie still. No muscle weakness though. My cousins jokingly call me a ""gentle giant,"" but I’m pretty sure I’m just a giant lump when the migraine hits.
D: Have you noticed any triggers? Changes in your routine, diet, or sleep?
P: That’s the tricky part. I’ve tried tracking things, but I’m up late analyzing reports or, you know, getting sucked into city politics again. I’m skipping meals more than I should, and caffeine’s been...well, not exactly moderate. I guess you could say work obsession is my main hobby and trigger.
D: It sounds like stress and sleep are big factors. Any changes in medication or supplements since last time?
P: I’m still taking the sumatriptan if I catch an attack early, but sometimes I don’t realize I’m getting a migraine until it’s full-blown. And I’ve been trying magnesium on your suggestion, but not super consistent. No other new meds. I avoid NSAIDs when my stomach acts up. Oh, and I started vitamin D after my uncle said city folks are all deficient.
D: Have you had any days where you couldn't function at all, or missed important events?
P: Yeah, and it’s starting to weigh on me. I missed a city council session I’d looked forward to for a month. And I bailed out of my family dinner last weekend. My uncle gave me a hard time, but he gets it. Still, I feel guilty letting folks down, especially when everyone’s rooting for me to keep pushing ahead career-wise.
D: I hear you, Terrence. It’s tough feeling like headaches have that much control. Have you tried anything non-medication related for relief—like relaxation techniques or physical therapy?
P: I bought a meditation app. I like the narrator’s voice more than the actual meditating. Jazz helps, unless I’m already sensitive to sound. I’ve started cycling again—at least I try to—but sometimes it’s like my head’s too heavy to put on a helmet.
D: That’s honest. Let’s talk about managing your workload and routine, too. For now, would you be open to trying a preventive medication, not just treating attacks after they start?
P: Yeah, I’m open to it. If it could help me regain some consistency—that’d be huge. I just want to function enough to finish my grant proposal before the deadline and, you know, not be sidelined when my community actually wants my input.
D: Absolutely, that’s what we’re aiming for. I’ll go over a couple of options with you and we can choose together. Any questions or concerns?
P: Just...will the preventive mess with my focus or make me foggier? I can’t afford to lose my edge, even if it’s just research edge. Plus, anything that would interact weirdly with coffee or the occasional late-night snack?
D: Those are good questions. I’ll explain the side effects and interactions of each, and we’ll pick what fits you best. I also want to suggest some concrete steps for your routine, like scheduled breaks.
P: Sounds good. I appreciate that. I know I’m my own worst enemy with scheduling sometimes, but hearing it from you might kick my accountability up a notch. Should we loop my uncle in on this? He likes to be in the know, just in case.
D: That could be helpful, especially for support. We can also look into local headache resources. Let’s get started with a plan.
P: Thanks, Dr. Nguyen. I may know a lot about statistics, but I’ll leave the treatment algorithm to you. And, uh, maybe you can keep me honest on the sleep thing, too.
D: Deal. Let’s work together on this.

gpt-5,low,"P: Morning. Before we start, if you’re about to say “how are we today,” please don’t. I’m not “we,” and I’m tired.
D: Good morning, Monica. Thanks for being direct. What’s been going on?
P: Two months of legs behaving like overcooked noodles. Stairs are a joke. Fatigue is worse—like someone pulled my battery and forgot to plug me back in.
D: When did the weakness start exactly, and has it been constant or fluctuating?
P: Started about nine weeks ago. Worse in the afternoon. Heat makes it uglier. Mornings used to be decent, now they’re mediocre at best.
D: Any new numbness, vision changes, bladder issues, or balance changes?
P: No new blurry vision. Balance is wobblier—think table with one short leg. Bladder urgency is a bit more, but no burning. Numbness is the usual glove-sock nonsense.
D: Any fevers, recent infections, or new medications?
P: No fevers. I had a mild cold three weeks back. No antibiotics. Meds are the same.
D: Remind me—your current MS therapy is ocrelizumab every six months, last infusion was when?
P: Mid-May. So I’m due in November. And yes, I can feel the “end-of-dose” creep. Like clockwork.
D: Understood. Any infusion-related side effects last time or increased infections since?
P: Infusion was fine. I’ve had more colds this year, nothing dramatic. Still masking on transit because, well, I like breathing.
D: How’s your walking distance now compared to three months ago?
P: Three months ago I could do six city blocks with my cane. Now two blocks and I need to sit or I’m swearing at strangers.
D: Have you had any falls?
P: One near-fall grabbing my kitchen counter. Pride hurt, not bones.
D: How’s sleep?
P: Patchy. I shoot photos at night sometimes, but even on “good behavior,” I wake up a lot. Brain won’t shut up. Anxiety plays DJ.
D: Any snoring, witnessed apneas, or morning headaches?
P: I live alone, so no witnesses. No morning headaches. I do wake with jaw tension.
D: How’s mood overall?
P: Hovering between “functional” and “don’t poke the bear.” I’m anxious about money and my visa—surprise—and angry at my body when it forgets it’s mine.
D: Thank you for being candid. From what you’re describing, we need to determine if this is a true relapse, progression, or end-of-dose effect plus fatigue. I’d like to order an MRI of brain and cervical spine with and without contrast. Okay?
P: Fine. Just don’t schedule it at 7 a.m. I’m not a sunrise person.
D: Noted. Any issues with the scanner or contrast previously?
P: No. I just hate the noises. I’ll deal.
D: I’ll also check labs: CBC, CMP, thyroid, vitamin D, B12, ferritin, and a urinalysis to make sure there isn’t a silent UTI worsening symptoms. Sound reasonable?
P: Reasonable and boring. Do it.
D: For the fatigue, we can try a medication like modafinil or amantadine. Modafinil can help with daytime alertness. Interested?
P: I’ll try modafinil. If it makes me jittery, I’m firing you via email. Kidding. Mostly.
D: We’ll start low and monitor. For walking speed, dalfampridine can help some patients. It does carry a seizure risk if there’s a history or poor kidney function. No seizure history for you, correct?
P: Correct. No seizures. If it helps me beat a stoplight, I’m in.
D: I’ll check kidney function with the labs and, if clear, we can start it. Physical therapy focused on gait and endurance would also help. Are you willing?
P: If they don’t talk to me like I’m made of glass, yes. Prefer afternoons.
D: I’ll refer you to a neuro PT team that’s good with MS. We can also explore a lightweight rollator for longer distances—gives you a seat when you need it.
P: I hate the look, but I hate sidewalks more. Fine—show me options that don’t scream hospital.
D: Understood. Regarding ocrelizumab timing, given your symptoms, we can check B-cell levels. If they’ve repopulated early, we could discuss moving the next infusion slightly sooner within safety parameters. Alternatively, switching to ofatumumab or ublituximab is an option. Thoughts?
P: I like predictable infusions twice a year. Monthly shots sound like another chore. If we can nudge the timing without playing roulette, let’s do that first.
D: Okay. If MRI shows active lesions or B-cells are up, we’ll justify an earlier infusion. If there’s breakthrough disease despite timing, we’ll revisit switching.
P: Works for me. I just need something that doesn’t trash my routine.
D: Any side effects from current meds—spasticity meds, vitamin D, or anything else?
P: Baclofen makes me floppy if I take too much, so I micro-dose at night. Vitamin D daily. No drama.
D: For spasticity and sleep, a very small dose of baclofen earlier in the evening might help with nighttime awakenings. Want to try adjusting timing?
P: Sure. If I turn into a noodle, I’m blaming you.
D: Fair. Vaccinations—are you up to date on flu and COVID this season?
P: Not yet. I’ll do both, preferably not the same day as the MRI. My arm needs a break.
D: We can give flu here today if you’d like; COVID at the pharmacy near you.
P: Do the flu shot here. Saves me a trip.
D: Great. Any concerns about insurance coverage for MRI, labs, PT, or medications?
P: Always. But I’ve budgeted, and I’ll fight them if they get cute. Send the notes with the right magic words.
D: I’ll document medical necessity clearly. Do you feel safe at home with transfers and showering?
P: Yes. I added grab bars and a bench. My apartment’s more ADA-chic than IKEA now.
D: Good. Heat sensitivity—keep cooling strategies handy: cooling vest, fans, pre-cooling before walks.
P: I’ve got a vest. I look like I’m about to guide planes on a runway, but it works.
D: Perfect. Plan recap: MRI brain and cervical spine with/without contrast; labs including B-cells; urinalysis; start modafinil low dose; consider dalfampridine pending kidney function; PT referral; evaluate rollator options; flu shot today; consider slightly earlier ocrelizumab depending on results; adjust baclofen timing.
P: That’s a lot of boxes, but I like boxes. When do I hear back?
D: I’ll message you within 48 hours of labs and within 2–3 days of the MRI. If anything urgent appears, I’ll call.
P: Good. If I ghost you, it’s because I’m napping.
D: If weakness acutely worsens for more than 24–48 hours without signs of infection, contact me—steroids might be appropriate.
P: Copy that. No heroics, just call you before I fall apart.
D: Anything else you want to address today?
P: Just one thing—please don’t tell me to “think positive.” I’m already doing the work. I need data and options.
D: Data and options are exactly what we’ll provide.
P: Then we’re good. Let’s stab me with the flu shot and set up the MRI.
D: I’ll have the nurse come in now. Thanks, Monica.
P: Thank you. And hey—nice not being sugar-coated for once.

gpt-5-mini,low,"P: Morning, Doc. Dennis Callahan. Been a while since I seen you — been trying to keep busy in the yard, but I’m getting winded more than I used to. Thought it was time to come in and have you take a look.
D: Good morning, Mr. Callahan. Nice to see you. How long have the shortness of breath episodes been increasing?
P: Couple months, I guess. Used to be I could mow, haul a few bags of soil, climb under that old Chevy without trouble. Lately I’m stopping halfway through a row of tomatoes, wheezing a bit, gotta sit. It’s worse when it’s humid, and once or twice I had to sit down and catch my breath for ten, fifteen minutes.
D: Any chest pain, dizziness, or fainting with those episodes?
P: No chest pain, thank the Lord. Heart’s been fine. Just the breath—tightness, some wheeze. I cough more in the mornings, sometimes bring up a little clear phlegm. No fevers or anything like that.
D: Any increase in rescue inhaler use or oral steroids or antibiotics recently?
P: I’ve been using my albuterol about twice as much. No steroids or antibiotics this time. I do have the inhaled steroid combo you gave me — that purple one — I take it every morning like you said. But lately I feel like it’s not keeping me doing what I want.
D: You’re on a LABA/ICS combo daily and using albuterol PRN. Have you been taking the daily inhaler regularly?
P: Mostly. I won’t lie — some days I forget, or I’m out in the garage and figure I’ll do it later. Sandra nags me, says I’m stubborn. She’s right sometimes.
D: How about inhaler technique? Can I watch you use it so I can be sure it’s working properly?
P: Sure. I can show you. Shake, breathe out, press and breathe in. Like that.
D: Okay, try to take a slow, deep inhalation when you press down and hold your breath for a few seconds. You exhaled a bit too quickly after. Also, rinsing your mouth after the steroid inhaler helps prevent thrush.
P: Alright. I’ll do the slow breath and rinse. Didn’t know about the rinsing—Sandra’ll like that tip.
D: Good. Any history of hospitalizations or ER visits for COPD exacerbations?
P: Years back I had one bad fall—sorry—one bad spell where I ended up in the ER for a night, put on steroids. That was maybe five years ago. Since then, none of that sort.
D: Do you use supplemental oxygen at home?
P: No, I don’t. Don’t want to be tethered to anything if I can help it.
D: Do you smoke or have a history of smoking?
P: I did smoke when I was younger — started in my twenties, quit when I turned fifty. Been cigarette-free fifteen, sixteen years now. Took me a while to kick it. Best decision I ever made besides marrying Sandra.
D: That quitting helps a lot. Your oxygen levels today — let me check. Sitting oxygen saturation is 95%. That's acceptable. I’d like you to do a six-minute walk later so we can see how activity affects it.
P: Sure, I can walk. Even got a route I’m proud of by the river. Might be the garden that does me in more than walking — bending over, lugging pots.
D: Bending and exertion can trigger breathlessness. Pulmonary rehab could help — breathing techniques, endurance training, and energy conservation strategies. Would you consider that?
P: Depends on the time, but I’m not afraid of work. If it’ll let me haul that toolbox under the Chevy and finish a wheel well without panting, I’m in.
D: It often helps people stay active. I’ll refer you. Also, we should review your medications. I want to make sure your maintenance inhaler dose is optimized. You’re on inhaled steroid/LABA — we can consider adding a long-acting muscarinic antagonist as a third controller if symptoms persist. How do you feel about adding one if needed?
P: If it keeps me in the garden and out of the recliner, fine by me. I just don’t want a pocket full of bottles for every cough.
D: Understandable. We’ll try simple adjustments first — ensure adherence and technique, start pulmonary rehab, and after the six-minute walk and spirometry we’ll decide about adding medication. Any side effects from current meds? Tremor, palpitations?
P: The rescue inhaler makes my hands shake a little if I do more than two puffs. Other than that, nope.
D: That’s common. We can counsel on limiting rescue use and relying on the maintenance inhaler. I also recommend getting an annual flu shot and a pneumococcal vaccine if you haven’t had one. Are your vaccines up to date?
P: I got my flu shot last year. Don’t recall the pneumonia shot — Sandra keeps those records. She’s better at them than I am.
D: I’ll check your chart and order the pneumococcal vaccine if you haven’t had it. Also, bring a list of any other medications or over-the-counter supplements you take.
P: I take my blood pressure pill, a statin they put me on a while back, aspirin sometimes, and an OTC joint pill Sandra swears by. I’ll bring the bottle.
D: Good. Any nighttime symptoms — waking up short of breath or with coughing fits?
P: Sometimes I cough a bit at night, wake up a time or two. I sleep propped up some on weekends when I read the paper in the recliner.
D: That’s helpful. For now: continue your daily inhaler, focus on technique and rinsing, limit albuterol use to as-needed, start pulmonary rehab, and I’ll order spirometry, six-minute walk, and check vaccines. If your shortness worsens acutely, or you develop fever, increased sputum production or green phlegm, come in or go to the ER — you may need steroids or antibiotics.
P: Sounds fair. I don’t like to bother folks, but I’ll come in if it gets worse. One more thing — is there anything I can do at home when I’m out weeding besides sit down and complain?
D: Yes. Pacing your work, taking frequent short breaks, using a stool for tasks at lower levels, and breathing through pursed lips during exertion can help. Also, using a wheeled cart to move heavy pots instead of carrying them.
P: Pursed lips, huh? I can do that. Sounds fancy for an old boy. I’ll try the cart — saves my back too. I appreciate you taking the time, Doc. Got to get back to Sandra before she starts baking and I miss out on a slice of her chess pie.
D: Glad we talked. I’ll arrange the tests and referral, tweak meds if needed after results, and we’ll see you in six weeks or sooner if you need. Any other concerns?
P: Nope. Just keep me able to keep the truck rolling and the tomatoes producing. Thanks.
D: You’re welcome, Mr. Callahan. See you soon.

gpt-5,high,"P: Morning, Doctor. Michelle Harper. I’ve got my notes and, fair warning, I’ve been humming all morning to keep my nerves steady.
D: Good morning, Michelle. I’m glad you’re here. How have your hands been since we last met?
P: Busy season plus tomatoes to stake—my fingers are not amused. Stiff most mornings, pain by mid-afternoon, and my right thumb base complains whenever I open jars or chop.
D: Where exactly is the pain, and how long does the morning stiffness last?
P: DIPs on the index and ring fingers, both hands. And the base of the right thumb, especially. Stiffness about 20 minutes in the morning. No redness, just those little bony bumps getting bossier.
D: Any numbness, tingling, or dropping objects?
P: No numbness, no tingling. Grip’s weaker by day’s end, but I’m not dropping things.
D: What are you currently using for relief?
P: Voltaren gel when I remember—maybe twice a day. Ibuprofen 400 mg once or twice a week if it’s bad. Warm water in the morning, sometimes the paraffin bath at my yoga studio. I tried thin compression gloves at night; they help a bit.
D: How is it affecting work and sleep?
P: Typing long spreadsheets escalates the ache to a six by 3 p.m. I’m waking up once or twice a week around two a.m., hands throbbing. Not ideal for a process analyst who likes clean lines and clean sleep.
D: Understood. Let’s review your labs. Your inflammatory markers—ESR and CRP—are normal. Rheumatoid factor and anti-CCP are negative. Uric acid is normal. Vitamin D is 33. Kidney and liver function are normal. Lipids are steady, A1c 5.6.
P: So we’re still firmly in osteoarthritis territory, not something autoimmune?
D: Correct. Your pattern and labs are consistent with hand osteoarthritis.
P: Okay. I can work with a name. I just want a clear plan that lets me keep cooking and working without living on pills.
D: On exam today, I’m seeing small Heberden and Bouchard nodes, tenderness at the right thumb CMC, mild grip weakness, and no warmth or synovitis. Here’s a layered plan.
P: I’m listening.
D: First, make the topical NSAID routine: diclofenac gel to the painful joints up to four times daily, scheduled for the next 4–6 weeks.
P: Timers on my phone, done.
D: Second, splinting. A soft thumb CMC brace for daytime tasks like chopping or opening jars, and at night. For those DIPs, ring splints can prevent hyperextension. I’ll refer you to hand therapy to size and train you.
P: Are those the sleek silver ones that look like jewelry? I can live with that.
D: Yes, or a clear version. Third, heat in the morning for stiffness—warm soak or paraffin—then brief icing after heavy use. Fourth, targeted exercises: thumb stabilization, gentle tendon glides, and joint protection techniques. OT will teach you a home program.
P: How many sessions?
D: Usually 4–6 to get you set up. You’ll do most of it at home.
P: Medication-wise, I’d prefer not to lean on oral NSAIDs. Sensitive stomach.
D: That’s fine. We’ll prioritize topical. For breakthrough pain, acetaminophen up to 3,000 mg/day is an option if you need it, and we can reserve short NSAID courses with food; we’d add stomach protection if you ever need a longer stretch.
P: What about injections for the thumb? I keep hearing the base-of-thumb shot can buy time.
D: A corticosteroid injection into the CMC joint can reduce pain for a few months. It’s quick: local anesthetic, brief pressure, soreness for a day or two. Limit to a few per year. If splints and topical therapy don’t get you there in 6–8 weeks, we can schedule it.
P: Could I still cook that weekend?
D: Rest the thumb the first 24 hours, then ease back. By Sunday, most patients can chop gently.
P: Supplements—give me the honest bottom line. Chondroitin? Turmeric? Collagen?
D: Chondroitin sulfate 800 mg daily has some evidence for hand OA and is safe; choose a quality brand. Turmeric/curcumin can offer modest relief; avoid if you’re on blood thinners. Glucosamine and collagen have inconsistent data for hands.
P: Noted. I’m not on blood thinners. Just vitamin D, magnesium at night, and the occasional melatonin.
D: Good. Keep me posted if you add anything new.
P: Work ergonomics—can you write a note for an evaluation? I want a split keyboard, a softer mouse, and permission for scheduled microbreaks.
D: Absolutely. I’ll provide a detailed note recommending equipment and 5-minute microbreaks each hour.
P: Any tricks for the kitchen and garden?
D: Use wide-handled utensils, a jar key instead of gripping, a cutting board with spikes or a non-slip mat, and ratcheting pruners. Avoid sustained pinch; let tools do the work.
P: That feels oddly luxurious. I approve.
D: Also, a soft brace during higher-demand tasks and the ring splints for precision work can make a big difference.
P: Travel question—I’m in Portugal next month. Long flight, lots of menus to read, lots of corks to not wrestle with.
D: Bring the thumb brace, a small travel tube of gel, and lightweight compression gloves for evenings. Micro-stretches during the flight. Use a waiter’s corkscrew or ask for help—no heroic cork-pulling.
P: Fine, I’ll be decisive and charming instead of stubborn.
D: Sleep-wise, warm soak and stretches before bed, splint at night, and keep the phone away from the pillow. Pain control should help the 2 a.m. wake-ups.
P: If we do all this and I’m still stuck?
D: Next step would be the CMC injection. If pain remains severe after that and months of conservative care, we can discuss a hand surgeon consult. Options include thumb CMC procedures or DIP fusion, depending on the joint.
P: I like having a roadmap. What’s our timeline?
D: Let’s set six weeks of scheduled topical therapy, splints, and OT. Message me at week three with a quick update. If pain remains above a four with activity at week six, we’ll plan the injection.
P: That’s clean. Can we check kidney and liver function again in three months if I end up using more NSAIDs?
D: Yes. I’ll order labs to activate if needed.
P: Thank you. I’m trying not to be dramatic, but cooking and typing are my happy places.
D: I hear you. We’ll protect both. I’ll send the OT referral, brace recommendations, supplement guidance, and the work note to your portal today.
P: Appreciate it. I’ll trade you a solid execution plan for fewer 2 a.m. solos.
D: Deal. See you in six weeks, and sooner if you need me.
P: Thanks, Doctor. I’ll go schedule OT and buy a jar key before my next sauce day.

gpt-5,medium,"D: Hi Ethan! Good to see you. I heard you’ve had a bit more wheezing at school. How are you feeling right now?
P: Hi, Dr. Lee! I’m okay now. Earlier this week I sounded kinda like a squeaky toy—like “weeEEze”—when we were playing tag. My chest felt like a backpack strap was too tight.
D: Thanks for telling me. When did that start getting worse?
P: Umm… last week? At recess on Monday and Thursday, and during PE yesterday. I had to sit down, which was booooring.
D: Did you use your blue inhaler when that happened?
P: Yup. Two puffs. It went “pssh pssh.” Helped after a few minutes, but I still felt slow, like my lungs were lagging like a video game.
D: About how many times did you use the blue inhaler this week?
P: Three times at school, once at home after dancing. Four total.
D: Any coughing at night?
P: Yeah. Two nights I woke up and coughed. Mom brought water and I did my inhaler. Then I did this slow-breath thing like I’m blowing out birthday candles in slow motion.
D: Good job using slow breaths. Are you taking your orange inhaler every day?
P: I do it before school. But on weekends I kinda forget because cartoons and pancakes. I know, I know.
D: Thanks for being honest. Do you use your spacer with both inhalers?
P: Mostly. Sometimes I can’t find it and I do it without. But I brought it today!
D: Perfect. Any colds or allergies lately? Sneezing, itchy eyes, runny nose?
P: My nose gets tickly outside. And the trees are attacking me with their yellow dust. Also Grandma’s cat makes me wheeze if I cuddle him. He’s so fluffy though.
D: Any smoke at home, or strong smells like candles or cleaners?
P: No smoke. Dad hates candles. He says they make him sneeze like a trumpet.
D: How about gym or playground—does cold air make it worse?
P: When it’s windy, yep. If we do sprints, I’m fine for a minute, then I’m like “kzzzz”—kazoo lungs.
D: Got it. I’m going to listen to your lungs and check your oxygen, okay?
P: Okay. I’ll sit still like a statue. A dancing statue… kidding! I’ll be still.
D: Deep breaths in and out… Good. I hear a little wheeze on the left, but your oxygen is 98%, which is good. Your peak flow is a bit lower than your usual, so your airways are a little tight today.
P: I knew it. My chest feels tiny, like a snack-size bag instead of the big party bag.
D: Here’s the plan. First, use your orange inhaler every morning and every night, every day, even weekends. That keeps the swelling down. Rinse your mouth after.
P: Morning and night. Even pancakes day. Got it.
D: Second, use your blue inhaler 15 minutes before running, PE, or dance practice. Two puffs with the spacer. That helps prevent the kazoo lungs.
P: Pre-game power-up! Nice.
D: We’ll also give you a written asthma action plan—the green, yellow, and red zones. I’ll send a copy to your school nurse so you can keep playing safely.
P: Can I still learn the new K-pop routine? It’s super fast.
D: Yes, with your pre-exercise puffs and a gentle warm-up. If you start to feel tight, pause, do your inhaler, and rejoin when you feel better.
P: Okay. I’ll do a slow-mo warm-up first. Then boom.
D: Try to keep the cat out of your bedroom when you visit Grandma, and shower or change clothes after outdoor play on high-pollen days. Windows closed on very windy days can help.
P: I’ll still pet Mr. Fluff politely… from a distance.
D: Let’s check your inhaler technique with the spacer. Show me.
P: Shake-shake, click, lips sealed, slow breath in… hold… one Mississippi, two Mississippi… ten! Then breath out like a ninja.
D: Excellent. Just remember a slow, deep breath for each puff and wait about 30 seconds between puffs.
P: Thirty seconds. I can count in two languages. Makes it feel faster.
D: If you need your blue inhaler more than every four hours, or if you’re waking up most nights, have chest pain, or your lips look bluish, tell an adult and get help right away.
P: Tell Mom or Dad, or the teacher. No hero moves.
D: I’ll refill both inhalers, give you a spare spacer for your backpack, and send notes to school. Let’s meet again in four weeks to see how you’re doing.
P: Cool. I’ll bring my best breathing. And maybe a new dance.
D: Deal. Any other questions?
P: Can I get a sticker even if I’m ten?
D: Absolutely. Pick one. And great job today.
P: Thanks, Dr. Lee! I’m gonna breathe like a champ.

gpt-5-mini,medium,"P: Mornin', Doc. Dennis Callahan. Sorry I'm late — Sandra made a pie and insisted I taste it. Can't say no to that.
D: Good morning, Dennis. Nice to meet you — pie smells like a good excuse. How have you been since our last visit?
P: Eh. Been better. My wind's been goin' south on me. I get out in the garden, hauling soil or bending over the beds, and I'm huffin' like I ran a race. Used to be I could work half a day and feel fine. Lately it's stepping outside that does it.
D: How long has this increased shortness of breath been going on?
P: Couple months, really. It's sneaky — worse on days I'm doin' heavier work. Took the truck out last week to grab parts, climbed in the bed, and I had to sit for five minutes. Sandra gives me that look — you know the one.
D: I do. Any cough, change in sputum, fever, chest pain, swelling in your legs?
P: A bit more cough than usual. White-ish phlegm mostly. No fever. No chest pain, and my feet ain't swellin'. I do get tired fast, though.
D: Have you had any COPD exacerbations or been to the ER recently?
P: No ER. Had a bad spell two winters ago and ended up on a prednisone taper for about a week. That helped. Don't remember any hospital stays.
D: Smoking history?
P: I smoked when I was younger — started in my twenties. Quit cold turkey about 15 years ago when I walked into a manufacturing plant and thought, ""This is no life."" No cigarettes since.
D: Good you quit. What medications are you on now for COPD?
P: I take Spiriva — that's the once-a-day one in that little inhaler. I keep an albuterol rescue inhaler in the truck and my coat. Don't have any inhaled steroid, though my sister keeps tellin' me to ask about one.
D: Any trouble using the inhalers? Do you use a spacer with the albuterol?
P: No spacer. Doc, I confess — I sometimes don't shake it or I rush through it. Not proud of that. Old habits.
D: Alright. Let me check your vitals and listen to your lungs. Do you mind sitting back?
P: Not at all.
D: Your oxygen saturation on room air is 94% at rest. Lungs have some wheeze and decreased air entry bilaterally, more at the bases. Heart sounds normal. Your blood pressure and heart rate are fine.
P: 94 — that don't sound terrible. I was hopin' I wouldn't be put on oxygen. I like gettin' out and about.
D: 94% is okay at rest for now; doesn't indicate immediate need for home oxygen. We want to keep it that way. Given your symptoms, I want to review and tighten up your COPD plan so you can stay active.
P: I like the sound of that. What do you reckon?
D: First, medication: you're on a long-acting antimuscarinic — good. I'd like to make sure it's the best fit for you. We can consider adding a long-acting beta-agonist or a combination LAMA/LABA inhaler if symptoms persist. Also, if you have frequent exacerbations, an inhaled corticosteroid might help. But before changing meds, I want to ensure your inhaler technique is correct and that you're taking medicines consistently.
P: Sounds reasonable. I don't much like adding pills, but if it keeps me out in the garden and under my truck, I'm all ears.
D: We'll review technique right now. For the Spiriva, you breathe out away from the device, seal your lips around it, inhale deeply and hold for ten seconds. For albuterol with a metered-dose inhaler, using a spacer makes it much easier and more effective. I can give you a spacer today.
P: Show me. I swore I'd been doin' it right all these years.
D: I'll demonstrate and then watch you do it. Small changes make a big difference.
P: Fair enough. And those breathing exercises folks talk about — pursed-lip stuff — does that really help?
D: Yes. Pursed-lip breathing slows expiration and reduces air trapping. Also, pacing activity, taking frequent short rests, and using energy-conserving techniques in the garden will help. Raised beds, a small rolling seat, or a cart for tools instead of carrying heavy loads will make a world of difference.
P: I built my raised beds myself. Won't stop me from saggin' my back, though. A rollin' seat, huh? Might make me feel lazy.
D: It's not laziness — it's smart planning. Keeps you doing what you love longer. We can also time bronchodilator use: take your albuterol 10–15 minutes before starting heavy work to help.
P: That's a nugget I can use. I like practical tips.
D: Good. Next, pulmonary rehab — a structured program with exercise, breathing techniques, and education. It helps people with COPD regain endurance and confidence.
P: Doc, I've heard about that. Is it one of them hospital classes? I'd be the oldest there, probably.
D: Many programs are community-based and tailored. You're not too old; you're 66 and still active. It could get you back to lifting that wrench without feelin' like you ran a hill.
P: Alright. If you say it'll get me back under the truck, I'll try it. But I'm stubborn — I want results.
D: Fair. I'll refer you. Also, vaccines — are you up to date on your flu shot and pneumococcal vaccines? COVID booster?
P: I get a flu shot each year at the diner clinic. Not sure about pneumococcal. Took a COVID shot when they handed 'em out; haven't fussed with boosters lately.
D: We'll check your records and give any due vaccines today if you'd like. They reduce serious lung infections which can really set you back.
P: Do it. And what's your thought on antibiotics or steroids if I have another bad spell like I did back in winter?
D: If you develop increased shortness of breath, a change in sputum color or volume, or fever, that's concerning for an exacerbation. We can give you a written action plan and consider a ""rescue pack"" of prednisone and an antibiotic, depending on your symptoms. But I prefer assessing you before giving those routinely.
P: A plan sounds sensible. Saves Sandra from naggin' me to go in.
D: We'll make it clear: when to call, when to come in, and when to go to the ER. Also, I'd like to order spirometry to see where your lung function stands now and possibly a chest X-ray if anything points to infection.
P: Won't mind another breathing test. Did one about three years back, I think.
D: Great. I'll place the orders. Any other medical issues — reflux, sleep problems, heart trouble?
P: Other than the occasional heartburn after too much pie, I'm fine. No chest pains. Sleep's decent, though I wake once or twice to go to the bathroom.
D: Alright. Medication refills — do you need the Spiriva or albuterol refilled now?
P: Albuterol's about half used. Spiriva's due next month. If you think adding something else, I want to know what it is before I start.
D: I'll give you a refill for albuterol today, and we'll hold Spiriva refills until we talk about any changes after we review your spirometry and inhaler demonstration. I'll also give you a spacer and show you how to use it. I'll place a referral to pulmonary rehab and order spirometry and vaccines as needed.
P: Appreciate that. Do I need to see a specialist, or is this something we can manage here?
D: We can manage it together, and the pulmonologist referral is available if your spirometry or symptoms suggest we need specialized care. Many patients do well with good primary care management plus pulmonary rehab.
P: Fine by me. One last thing — any do's or don'ts for gettin' back in the yard? I don't want to overdo it, but I don't want to stop either.
D: Do warm up, use your bronchodilator before heavier tasks, work in short intervals with rests, avoid working in the heat or when pollen or smoke levels are high, hydrate well, and use tools that reduce bending or lifting. If you feel severe breathlessness, chest pain, confusion, or blue lips, that's an emergency.
P: Alright. I'm gonna grumble about the pollen with the fellas at the diner, but I can live with that. Thanks, Doc.
D: You're welcome. Any questions about the meds, the breathing technique, or the rehab referral?
P: No further questions. Just don't take my toolbox while I'm not lookin'.
D: I won't. We'll get you back to work on that Chevy. I'll have the nurse bring the spacer and paperwork. If anything changes before your appointment, call us.
P: Much obliged. Tell Sandra I said I approve the pie — for medicinal purposes.

gpt-5,high,"P: Morning. I’m Marcus. I finally decided to stop pretending the headaches are “character building” and see someone who actually knows what they’re doing.
D: I’m glad you came in, Marcus. I’m Dr. Patel. Tell me what’s been going on.
P: Migraines. The kind that shut down the screen and the brain. They’ve started stepping on deadlines at work.
D: How often?
P: Lately six to eight days a month. Spiky—clustered around big reports or the week after.
D: How long do they last?
P: If I don’t catch them early, 8 to 24 hours. Sometimes there’s a day-after fog.
D: Where is the pain?
P: Left temple, sometimes behind the left eye. Throbbing. Moving around makes it angry.
D: Intensity?
P: Seven to nine out of ten. On a bad one, I can tell you the exact number of ceiling tiles in my bedroom.
D: Any warning signs or aura?
P: About a third of the time I get a shimmering C-shaped zigzag that starts small and expands over 20 minutes. Rarely, my left fingers tingle for a few minutes. Then the headache hits.
D: Nausea? Light or sound sensitivity? Smell sensitivity?
P: Light and sound are the worst. Smells too—someone microwaves fish and the show’s over. Mild nausea, not a lot of vomiting.
D: Triggers you’ve noticed?
P: Fluorescent office lights, long screen time, skipping lunch, dehydration, red wine. Sleep debt. Also weirdly the “letdown” after a big push.
D: Anything make it better?
P: Darkness, silence, cold compress. Caffeine helps if I catch it early. I basically treat my apartment like a cave.
D: What have you been taking?
P: Ibuprofen 600 mg or Excedrin. Maybe 8–10 days a month. It works half the time. I’m aware of the rebound thing and I don’t want to fall into that trap.
D: Any “worst headache of your life,” sudden thunderclap pain?
P: No.
D: Fevers, stiff neck, head injury, or a new daily persistent headache?
P: No.
D: Vision changes that persist beyond the aura? Weakness, slurred speech, confusion?
P: No. Aura fades within 30 minutes. Then the fun begins.
D: Any other health conditions?
P: No.
D: Medications, vitamins, allergies?
P: No daily meds. No allergies I know of.
D: Family history of headaches?
P: My mom had migraines. She called them her “weather alarms.”
D: Sleep?
P: Six to six and a half hours most nights. Not consistent. Phone creeps in. I know.
D: Caffeine?
P: Two cups of coffee on weekdays. One or none on weekends, which might be part of the problem.
D: Alcohol, tobacco, other substances?
P: No tobacco, no drugs. One or two drinks a week. Red wine is a no-go.
D: Hydration and meals?
P: Could be better. I sometimes forget lunch when I’m deep in a dataset.
D: Exercise?
P: Light runs once or twice a week. Walks. I play chess in the park more than I lift weights.
D: Stress and mood?
P: Typical early-career stress. I like the work. I do worry about work-life balance and sometimes about being…a little too solo.
D: Understood. I’ll check your vitals and do a quick neuro exam.
P: Sure.
D: Blood pressure and heart rate look good. Neuro exam is normal—strength, sensation, reflexes, coordination, and eye movements are all intact.
P: That’s good to hear.
D: Based on what you’ve shared, this fits episodic migraine with visual aura. No red flags, so we don’t need imaging right now.
P: Works for me. I’d rather not pay for a fancy picture unless we need one.
D: Fair. Let’s talk plan. We’ll build two parts: a fast-acting treatment for attacks, and a preventive to reduce how often they happen.
P: Sounds like a policy memo. Acute and long-term.
D: Exactly. For acute therapy, I’d suggest a triptan. Rizatriptan 10 mg at onset—take it as soon as the aura starts or the pain begins. You can repeat once in two hours if needed, max 30 mg in 24 hours. It works better paired with an NSAID like naproxen 500 mg.
P: Okay. Any “gotchas”?
D: Don’t use it more than about 8–9 days a month to avoid rebound. Don’t use triptans if you have heart disease or uncontrolled blood pressure—you don’t. If nausea hits, metoclopramide 10 mg helps.
P: What about the newer meds? Gepants?
D: Ubrogepant or rimegepant are good and don’t constrict blood vessels. Effective and well tolerated. They’re pricier and insurance sometimes pushes triptans first. We can switch if triptans don’t work or you can’t tolerate them.
P: Let’s start with the affordable option.
D: For prevention, because you’re at 6–8 days a month and it’s impacting work, I recommend starting a daily preventive. Options: a beta blocker like propranolol; a tricyclic such as nortriptyline; topiramate; or CGRP blockers. Given your job needs crystal-clear thinking, I’d avoid topiramate due to cognitive side effects. Propranolol can cause fatigue and slow your heart rate. Nortriptyline at low dose can help sleep and headaches with less grogginess than amitriptyline.
P: Nortriptyline sounds like the compromise. Cost?
D: Generic and inexpensive.
P: Duly noted.
D: Start 10 mg at night for a week, then 20–25 mg if you feel okay. We reassess in 6–8 weeks. Goal is at least a 50% drop in migraine days.
P: I can live with that. If I feel too foggy in the mornings?
D: Message me. We can adjust the dose or switch to propranolol 20 mg twice daily. We’ll pick what your body tolerates.
P: How about supplements with decent evidence?
D: Magnesium glycinate 200–400 mg nightly and riboflavin 400 mg daily are reasonable. Main side effect is loose stools with magnesium—glycinate is easier on the stomach.
P: I’ll try those too.
D: Lifestyle levers help a lot. Practical moves: consistent sleep and wake times; don’t skip meals; hydrate; cap caffeine and keep it steady every day; short screen breaks—20-20-20 rule; dim or soften overhead lights; consider FL-41 tinted lenses for screens; gentle neck stretches.
P: I can ask the office for a desk lamp and turn off the fluorescents. And I’ll standardize the coffee.
D: Great. Keep a simple headache diary—date, time, severity, meds taken, possible trigger, and whether the acute meds worked. A spreadsheet is fine.
P: You’re speaking my language.
D: Two other notes. First, medication overuse: keep triptan days under 9 per month and NSAIDs under 15. Second, with aura there’s a small lifetime increase in stroke risk—higher if you smoke or have uncontrolled blood pressure. You don’t smoke; your BP is good. We’ll keep it that way.
P: Appreciate the straight talk. No smoking here. I’m frugal, not reckless.
D: If you need workplace accommodations—a note for flexible lighting, screen breaks, or a quiet space—I can write one.
P: That would help. My team’s supportive, but paper makes processes move.
D: Done. When a migraine starts, take rizatriptan 10 mg plus naproxen 500 mg, hydrate, dark room if you can. If nausea is bad, add metoclopramide.
P: Take at aura or pain onset. Limit to nine days a month. Got it.
D: Red flags—go to the ER or call: sudden “worst headache,” a new type that’s rapidly escalating, a headache with fever and stiff neck, weakness or trouble speaking, aura lasting over an hour, or a head injury.
P: Understood.
D: I’ll send in nortriptyline 10 mg nightly with instructions to increase after a week, rizatriptan 10 mg, naproxen 500 mg, and metoclopramide as needed. I’ll add a brief summary of lifestyle tips and a note for work.
P: Thank you. This feels…manageable. Like I finally put a framework around it.
D: Good. Let’s follow up in six weeks. Message me sooner if side effects hit or the plan isn’t working.
P: Will do. And, small win for me—asking for help is not my usual move.
D: It’s a smart move. See you soon, Marcus.
P: Thanks, Dr. Patel. I’ll start tonight and keep the log.

gpt-4.1,,"P: Uh, hi! Do I sit here or over there? Oh, sorry, yeah—I’ll sit here. Hi, Dr. Patel.
D: Hello Eli! It’s good to see you. How have you been feeling lately?
P: Umm… pretty good most days. But last week when I was practicing my dance—it’s like a really fast K-pop routine—I had to stop in the middle ’cause I started coughing. My chest kinda felt tight too. I told my mom, and she said we should come in.
D: I’m glad you did. Have you noticed the coughing and tightness happen at other times, too? Or mostly when you’re dancing?
P: Mostly when I’m dancing, yeah. Sometimes when we’re in gym at school, too, if we run a lot. It feels like I can’t get enough air, like someone’s squishing my lungs a little. Not always though, just some days.
D: I see. Does anything help when that happens? Do you use your inhaler?
P: Yeah. My mom brings it to all my dance stuff now. I used it last night after I finished my song—well, my routine, but I was listening to my song on repeat. The inhaler helps if I sit down and do it, but I wish I didn’t have to stop what I’m doing, you know?
D: I understand. How often have you needed to use your inhaler in the past week or so?
P: Ummm… three times since Sunday, I think? Monday, Wednesday, and then yesterday. I told my little sister I was like a steam train running out of puff, and she laughed and made chugga-chugga noises. She’s annoying, but funny sometimes.
D: Sounds like you two have a lot of fun together. Do you ever wake up at night because of coughing or trouble breathing?
P: Oh, just once this week. I think it was Tuesday? I barely remember ‘cause I was sleepy. But I coughed and went to get water. It stopped after that.
D: Thanks for telling me. Have you noticed if anything else makes it worse—like being outside, or when it’s cold?
P: Definitely cold air. Like, if I go out dancing with my friends when it’s cold, I get kinda wheezy faster. Not so much in the summer… unless there’s a lot of pollen or stuff flying around. I don’t like that.
D: That’s helpful to know. On days where you don’t dance or exercise a lot, do you still ever feel short of breath or cough?
P: Hm, not really. Only if my sister sprays her glitter hairspray near me—ugh, it’s so gross. Mostly it’s just when I’m moving and dancing a lot.
D: Okay. Let’s talk about your current asthma medicine. Are you taking it every day or just when you have symptoms?
P: I have the blue inhaler—wait, it’s albuterol, right?—that I use when it gets bad. I had a daily medicine too but I, um, kind of forgot to take it a couple times. My mom reminds me, but sometimes I just forget, especially if I’m late for practice.
D: That happens sometimes. It’s important to take your daily medicine even when you’re feeling okay. It helps prevent these episodes. Do you have any questions about your asthma or your medicines?
P: Oh! Does singing make it worse? I’m thinking about maybe signing up for the talent show, but what if my asthma gets weird on stage? Also, is there like a super inhaler for dancers? Or, I dunno, something cooler?
D: Singing can sometimes make you feel short of breath, but with good asthma control, you should be able to perform confidently. There isn’t a “super inhaler,” but we can work together to adjust your medicine routine so you can dance and sing without worrying as much. Would you like to talk about ways to remember your daily medicine?
P: Yeah, that would help. Mom says reminders on my tablet might work. I just get so into my music I forget about… everything!
D: That’s common! We can set up reminders together, and maybe your family can help too. Is there anything else worrying you about your asthma, or anything else you want to ask?
P: Ummm… sometimes I worry people will think I’m weird if I need my inhaler in front of them, or like, in the middle of a performance. But I don’t want to stop dancing. Not ever.
D: It’s very brave to talk about your worries, Eli. Lots of performers—even famous ones—manage asthma. With the right plan, you won’t have to stop doing what you love. If you want, I have some tips for using your inhaler quickly and discreetly. 
P: Really? Awesome. And—uh—do you know any doctors who can moonwalk? ‘Cause that’d be epic.
D: I might need some lessons from you first! Next time you’re here, maybe you can show me some moves.
P: Deal! Only if you promise not to use me as an example of “what not to do” at doctor school.
D: It’s a promise, Eli. Let’s get started on your asthma plan!
