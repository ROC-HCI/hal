W: 1984 by George Orwell. Yours?

W: I totally agree, films often miss the mark! I really loved Webber's musical, especially the soundtrack. The emotion in ""Music of the Night"" gets me every time. Have you ever seen it live?

W: Hey! My day's been pretty good so far, just getting started with this Turing test now. How about you?
I: Pretty good if I say so myself. Do you know what this Turing test is based off of?
W: Yep! The Turing test is named after Alan Turing, a famous mathematician and computer scientist. It's designed to see if a machine can exhibit intelligent behavior indistinguishable from a human. In this setting, we're trying to figure out who's human and who's not.","I: Hi how has you day been?
W: Hi, it's been pretty good, I woke up pretty late today around 10, since I'm not eating breakfast or anything this month because I'm fasting for Ramadan :)
I: Thats good im glad you are having a good day:) can you teach me about Ramadan
W: Essentially Ramadan is the month of the Islamic Lunar Calendar where Muslims fast from any food or water from sunrise to sunset, it's about developing empathy for those less fortunate, discipline to be able to fast, and community because we always share our meals with the community and people around us
I: Thats very interesting! I have heard a lot about Ramadan in the past but not enough to get a good picture about it. Well I really yhope you have a great rest of your day and month:)
